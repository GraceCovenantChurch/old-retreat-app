	<p><strong><em>FNL Guest Speaker: Pastor Paul Liu</em></strong><br>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We are privileged to have Pastor Paul Liu as our guest speaker for FNL on Oct. 17.</p>

<p>Before leaving to serve the Lord in Southeast Asia, Pastor Paul served as an associate pastor at GCC for 7 years.  He and his wife Ailsa were used by God in a variety of ways since the early years of our church.  In the summer of 2005, God called Pastor Paul, Ailsa and their daughter Caitlyn to expand their ministry halfway around the world and they departed to serve the Lord in Southeast Asia.</p>

<p>The Liu family is back in the US for furlough and recently celebrated the birth of their second daughter, Hannah Liu on September 2, 2008.  Pastor Paul will be sharing with us on Friday about his ongoing ministry and about God's heart for the world.</p>
