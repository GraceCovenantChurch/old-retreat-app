          <h4>What is the Gospel and Christianity All About?</h4>

<p>At 
                            Grace Covenant Church, we believe that accepting Jesus 
                            Christ as your personal Lord and Savior is the most 
                            important decision that any person can make. It is 
                            our prayer that after reading the following page you 
                            will ask Christ into your heart as your Savior or 
                            that you will renew your committment to live your 
                            life for Christ. Should you have any furthur questions 
                            or comments, please feel free to contact us.

                            He made us rulers of the world under him. </strong><br>

                            You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive glory

                            by your will they were created and have their being. 
                            - Revelation 4:11 </em><br>
                            <br>
                            The first point of the Christian message is that God 
                            is in charge of the world. He is the ruler, the supreme 
                            president, the king. Unlike human rulers, however, 
                            God always does what is best for his subjects. He 
                            is the kind of king you'd like to be ruled by.<br>
                            <br>
                            God rules the world because he made the world. Like 
                            a potter with his clay, God fashioned the world into 
                            just the shape he wished, with all its amazing details. 
                            He made it, and he owns it.<br>
                            <br>
                            He also made us. God created people who were something 
                            like himself, and put them in charge of the world to 
                            rule it, to care for it, to be responsible for it, 
                            and to enjoy all its beauty and goodness. He appointed 
                            humanity to supervise and look after the world, but 
                            always under his own authority, honoring him and obeying 
                            his directions.<br>
                            <br>
                            You can see this represented in the illustration above: 
                            God is the ruler (the crown) and humanity is created 
                            to live in and rule God's world under God's loving 
                            authority.<br>
                            It all sounds rather ideal: God in heaven, people 
                            ruling the world according to his directions, and 
                            everything right with the world. But everything is 
                            very obviously not right with us or the world.<br>

                          <p>The 
                            sad truth is that, from the very beginning, men and 
                            women everywhere have rejected God by doing things 
                            their own way. We all do this. We don't like someone 
                            telling us what to do or how to live, least of all 
                            God, and so we rebel against him in lots of different 
                            ways. We ignore him and just get on with our own lives; 
                            or we disobey his instructions for living in his world; 
                            or we shake our puny fists in his face and tell him 
                            to get lost.<br>
                            <br>
                            How ever we do it, we are all rebels, because we don't 
                            live God's way. We prefer to follow our own desires, 
                            and to run things our own way, without God. This rebellious, 
                            self-sufficient attitude is what the Bible calls &quot;sin&quot;.<br>
                            <br>
                            The trouble is, in rejecting God we make a mess not 
                            only of our own lives, but of our society and the 
                            world. The whole world is full of people bent on doing 
                            what suits them, and not following God's ways. We 
                            all act like little gods, with our own crowns, competing 
                            with one another. The result is misery. The suffering 
                            and injustice that we see around us all go back to 
                            our basic rebellion against God.<br>
                            <br>
                            By rebelling against God, we've made a terrible mess 
                            of things. The question is: what will God do about 
                            it?<br>

                          <p><strong><img src="http://www.gracecovenant.net/resources/images/twtl3.gif" align="right">God 
                            won't let us rebel forever. God's punishment for rebellion 
                            is death and judgment. </strong><br>
                            <br>
                            <em>Man is destined to die once, and after that to 
                            face judgment. - Hebrews 9:27</em></p>
                          <p>God 
                            cares enough about humanity to take our rebellion 
                            seriously. He calls us to account for our actions, 
                            because it matters to him that we treat him, and other 
                            people, so poorly. In other words, he won't let the 
                            rebellion go on forever.<br>
                            <br>
                            The sentence God passes against us is entirely just, 
                            because he gives us exactly what we ask for. In rebelling 
                            against God, we are saying to him, &quot;Go away. 
                            I don't want you telling me what to do. Leave me alone.&quot; 
                            And this is precisely what God does. His judgment 
                            on rebels is to withdraw from them, to cut them off 
                            from himself permanently. But since God is the source 
                            of life and all good things, being cut off from him 
                            means death and hell. God's judgment against rebels 
                            is an everlasting, God-less death.<br>
                            <br>
                            This is a terrible thing, to fall under the sentence 
                            of God's judgment. It is a prospect we all face, since 
                            we are all guilty of rebelling against God.<br>
                            Is that it then? Are we all destined for death and 
                            everlasting ruin? If not for God's own miraculous 
                            intervention, we would be. <br>

                            <br>
                            Because of his great love and generosity, God did 
                            not leave us to suffer the consequences of our foolish 
                            rebellion. He did something to save us. He sent his 
                            own divine son into our world to become a man: Jesus 
                            of Nazareth.<br>
                            <br>
                            Unlike us, Jesus didn't rebel against God. He always 
                            lived under God's rule. He always did what God said, 
                            and so did not deserve death or punishment. Yet Jesus 
                            did die. Although he had the power of God to heal 
                            the sick, walk on water and even raise the dead, Jesus 
                            allowed himself to be executed on a cross. Why?<br>
                            <br>
                            The Bible rings with the incredible news that Jesus 
                            died as a substitute for rebels like us. The debt 
                            that we owed God, Jesus paid by dying in our place. 
                            He took the full force of God's justice on himself, 
                            so that forgiveness and pardon might be available 
                            to us.<br>
                            <br>
                            All this is quite undeserved by us. It is a generous 
                            gift, from start to finish.<br>

                            what humanity was always meant to be: God's ruler 
                            of the world.<br>

                            judge of the world. The Bible promises that one day, 
                            he will return to call all of us to account for our 
                            actions.<br>
                            <br>
                            In the meantime, Jesus offers us new life, both now 
                            and eternally. Now, our sins can be forgiven through 
                            Jesus' death, and we can make a fresh start with God, 
                            no longer as rebels but as friends. In this new life, 
                            God himself comes to live within us by his Spirit. 
                            We can experience the joy of a new relationship with 
                            God.<br>
                            <br>
                            What's more, when we are pardoned through Jesus' death, 
                            we can be quite sure that when Jesus does return to 
                            judge, we will be acceptable to him. The risen Jesus 
                            will give us eternal life, not because we have earned 
                            it, but because he has died in our place.<br>

                            We can continue in our rebellion against God, and 
                            try to run our lives our own way without him. Sadly, 
                            this is the option that many people persist in.<br>
                            <br>
                            The end result is that God gives us what we ask for 
                            and deserve. He condemns us for our rejection of his 
                            rightful rule over our lives. We not only have to 
                            put up with the messy consequences of rejecting God 
                            here and now, but we face the dreadful prospect of 
                            an eternity of separation from him, without life or 
                            love or relationship.<br>
                            <br>
                            For those of us who have realised that our situation 
                            is hopeless, there is a lifeline. If we turn back 
                            to God and appeal for mercy, trusting in Jesus' death 
                            and resurrection, then everything changes.<br>
                            <br>
                            For a start, God wipes our slate clean. He accepts 
                            Jesus' death as payment for our sins, and freely and 
                            completely forgives us. He pours his own Spirit into 
                            our hearts and grants us a new life that stretches 
                            past death and into forever. We are no longer rebels, 
                            but part of God's own family as his adopted sons and 
                            daughters. We now live with Jesus as our ruler.<br>

                            The two ways to live could not be more different,

                            <p><strong>The following explains how you can receive

                          <p>You 
                            Can Receive Christ Right Now by Faith Through Prayer: 
                            (Prayer is talking with God) <br>
                            <br>
                            God knows your heart and is not so concerned with 
                            your words as He is with the attitude of your heart. 
                            The following is a suggested prayer: <br>
                            <br>
                            <em>Lord Jesus, I need You. Thank You for dying on 
                            the cross for my sins. I open the door of my life 
                            and receive You as my Savior and Lord. Thank You for 
                            forgiving my sins and giving me eternal life. Take 
                            control of the throne of my life. Make me the kind 
                            of person You want me to be.</em><br>
                            <br>
                            Does this prayer express the desire of your heart? 
                            If it does, I invite you to pray this prayer right 
                            now, and Christ will come into your life, as He promised.

                            Did you receive Christ into your life? According to 
                            His promise in Revelation 3:20, where is Christ right 
                            now in relation to you? Christ said that He would 
                            come into your life. Would He mislead you? On what 
                            authority do you know that God has answered your prayer?

                            <strong>The Bible Promises Eternal Life to All Who 
                            Receive Christ</strong><br>
                            &quot;The witness is this, that God has given us eternal 
                            life, and this life is in His Son. He who has the 
                            Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of 
                            God does not have the life. These things I have written 
                            to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, 
                            in order that you may know that you have eternal life&quot; 
                            (1 John 5:11-13). <br>
                            <br>
                            Thank God often that Christ is in your life and that 
                            He will never leave you (Hebrews 13:5). You can know 
                            on the basis of His promise that Christ lives in you 
                            and that you have eternal life from the very moment 
                            you invite Him in. He will not deceive you. <br>

                            <br>
                            <strong>Do Not Depend on Feelings</strong><br>
                            The promise of God's Word, the Bible - not our feelings 
                            - is our authority. The Christian lives by faith (trust) 
                            in the trustworthiness of God Himself and His Word. 
                            This train diagram illustrates the relationship among 
                            fact (God and His Word, faith (our trust in God and 
                            His Word) and feeling (the result of our faith and 
                            obedience). Read John 14:21) <br>
                            <br>
                            The train will run with or without the caboose. However, 
                            it would be useless to attempt to pull the train by 
                            the caboose. In the same way, as Christians we do 
                            not depend on feelings or emotions, but we place our 
                            faith (trust) in the trustworthiness of God and the 
                            promises of His Word. <br>

                            <strong>Now That You Have Received Christ</strong><br>
                            The moment you received Christ by faith, as an act 
                            of the will, many things happened, including the following: 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Christ came into your life (Revelation 3:20; Colossians 
                            1:27)<br>
                            Your sins were forgiven (Colossians 1:14)<br>
                            You became a child of God (John 1:12)<br>
                            You received eternal life (John 5:24)<br>
                            You began the great adventure for which God created 
                            you<br>
                            ................(John 10:10; 2 Corinthians 5:17; 1

                            <br>
                            Can you think of anything more wonderful that could 
                            happen to you than receiving Christ? Would you like 
                            to thank God in prayer right now for what He has done 
                            for you? By thanking God, you demonstrate your faith.

                            <strong>Suggestions for Christian Growth</strong><br>
                            Spiritual growth results from trusting Jesus Christ. 
                            &quot;The righteous man shall life by faith&quot; 
                            (Galatians 3:11). A life of faith will enable you 
                            to trust God increasingly with every detail of your 
                            life, and to practice the following: <br>
                            <br>
                            <strong>G</strong> ...Go to God in prayer daily (John 
                            15:7).<br>
                            <strong>R</strong> ...Read God's Word daily (Acts 
                            17:11); begin with the Gospel ofJohn.<br>
                            <strong>O</strong> ...Obey God moment by moment (John 
                            14:21).<br>
                            <strong>W</strong>...Witness for Christ by your life 
                            and words (Matthew 4:19; John 15:8).<br>
                            <strong>T</strong> ...Trust God for every detail 
                            of your life (1 Peter 5:7).<br>
                            <strong>H</strong> ...Holy Spirit - allow Him to control 
                            and empower your daily life and witness (Galatians 
                            5:16,17; Acts 1:8). <br>
                            <br>
                            <strong>Fellowship In A Good Church</strong><br>
                            God's Word instructs us not to forsake &quot;the assembling 
                            of ourselves together&quot; (Hebrews 10:25), Several 
                            logs burn brightly together, but put one aside on 
                            the cold hearth and the fire goes out. So it is with 
                            your relationship with other Christians. <br>
                            <br>
                            If you do not belong to a church, do not wait to be 
                            invited. Take the initiative; call the pastor of a 
                            nearby church where Christ is honored and His Word 
                            is preached. Start this week, and make plans to attend 
                            regularly. <br>
