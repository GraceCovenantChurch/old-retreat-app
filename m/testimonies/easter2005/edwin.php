            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em><strong><img src="http://www.gracecovenant.net/multimedia/pictures/pow/2005/032705/DSC_0481.JPG" width="458" height="305"></strong></em></font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My 
              Name is Edwin Baimpwi. I&#8217;m come from Kenya, a country located 
              in East Africa. I presently live in Philly and I&#8217;ve been attending 
              GCC for the past five years. I&#8217;m an architect by trade. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Testimonies 
              are not easy to give, well, at least on my part. For some time I 
              wondered what to say. After praying and petitioning God for help, 
              the first thing that I undertook to do was to ensure that it met 
              specific criteria. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Firstly, 
              that God would receive all the glory, that I would be strengthened 
              to stand before such a large audience and still leave them blessed, 
              and finally, that my testimony would be able to give you a glimpse 
              of God&#8217;s past faithfulness in my life, my present dealings 
              with God, and future hopes in Him. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
              Lord apprehended me at the age of 15 through some rather unorthodox 
              means. My dad, who happened to be a non-believer at that time, for 
              some very strange reason had conceived in his fertile imagination, 
              that in addition to spanking, the best way to raise disciplined 
              kids was by sending them to church. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He 
              faithfully made sure we were up on time on Sunday and sent us to 
              the nearest Church. That way he&#8217;d avoid having to endure through 
              the sermon with us.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
              went to boarding school for my high school education. He encouraged 
              me to look for Christian company while in school. There was a Christian 
              organization in the school commonly referred to as the Christian 
              Union or CU. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During 
              one holiday break, I found out that my dad had already predetermined 
              for me how the first two weeks of the holiday were to be spent. 
              He had heard of a Christian camp and paid for it well in advance. 
              He personally drove me there and even paid me a visit after the 
              first week.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
              was during this camp that I saw the display of the gifts of the 
              Holy Spirit for the first time. By gifts I mean that the preacher 
              was empowered by God to have specific details about the lives of 
              people that he never knew, there was healing of various diseases 
              and conviction of sin. I was greatly affected by this. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
              was taken in hook, line and sinker and I never turned back.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
              propulsion was now no longer from without, but from within. It was 
              an experience very akin to Acts 1:8, where God promised the disciples 
              the empowering by the Holy Spirit to be witnesses for Him to the 
              world. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
              found a new power and joy in my life; the Holy Spirit living in 
              me and empowering me to like and do those things which I was never 
              able to do willingly prior to this. The change was even apparent 
              to my dad. I started sharing my beliefs with him and sent him very 
              long letters while at school and always invited him to say the prayer 
              of salvation. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
              was a problem of his own making. I had no apologies to make. He 
              probably regretted actions. I never gave up on him. I prayed that 
              the Lord would soften his heart. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He 
              recently came to accept the Lord and I pray that he will find the 
              same inner propulsion that I found. This has to be a work of the 
              Lord like He did with me. That&#8217;s the farthest I can take it.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Presently, 
              God has been challenging me to live a life that is consistent with 
              His calling. All I have to do is to avail myself to His grace. Every 
              knowledge and/or revelation that He offers us has great responsibility 
              attending to it. He knows that we are weak and incapable of fulfilling 
              these just requirements, but has offered us a way through His Son 
              and therefore we are without excuse (Rom 8:2, 3).</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
              scriptures that are at the forefront of my mind are found in Rom 
              12:9-12.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As 
              far as my future hope is concerned, my eyes have caught but a glimpse 
              of the great things that God has in store for us and I&#8217;m taken 
              by the very thought that these things have been sealed with the 
              Holy Spirit as collateral and God cannot lie to us. <br>
              <br>
              During the past few weeks we went through the Daniel fast based 
              on the 10th chapter of the book. In glancing through the book of 
              Daniel we see that he could not understand the visions of the seventh 
              and eighth chapters and he earnestly asked God to help him understand. 
              </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
              the ninth chapter the angel Gabriel was sent, in answer to his prayers 
              to give him skill and understanding. After receiving this communication 
              he faced another obstacle and had to fast all kinds of goodies to 
              seek for an answer, but when the angel finally got to him he explained 
              the reason for the delay, but you realize that Daniel readily understood 
              the final vision, unlike before. God always answers prayer.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
              gladly commend this book to your attention. It has really challenged 
              me as far as my future as a Christian is concerned and what to look 
              out for as signs of the coming of the Lord. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
              closing I would like to offer I Thess 5: 1-4 to you. Implied in 
              this passage is that we should not be caught by surprise at the 
              day of His coming for we shall have read all the signs and understood 
              them. Thank you. </font></p>
