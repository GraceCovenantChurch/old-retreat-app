            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My 
              name is Roy Wong, a senior at Penn, studying Finance and Economics. 
              After graduation, I will be doing a one year Masters program in 
              London.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Before 
              I begin, I want to thank Pastor Young for this privilege to share 
              my testimony. I am dedicating this story as a gift to God and I 
              hope it will be a blessing to all of you.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
              once knew a cute little boy who grew up in Singapore. When he was 
              ten years old, his aunt brought his entire family to church for 
              the first time. He soon had to attend Sunday School with the other 
              kids in church. By the age of twelve, he started skipping some of 
              these classes because he felt that the girls were always laughing 
              at him. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So 
              while his parents attended the church service, he would be wandering 
              around the neighborhood. As he grew older, he would pretend to be 
              sick on Sunday mornings so that he could skip the church service. 
              Once his parents left the house, he would turn on the TV and watch 
              cartoons. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
              was always the TV&#8217;s fault for having the best cartoons on 
              Sunday mornings. Because of his behavior and lifestyle, most of 
              his friends never knew that he was a Christian. As you might have 
              guessed by now, I was that boy who was always running away from 
              God. =)</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
              have a girlfriend in Singapore. Most of my life story would revolve 
              around her as we have been together for five years and seven months 
              as of tomorrow.If you have a girlfriend, trust me, you need to remember 
              these things. =) </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My 
              girlfriend&#8217;s name is Ziying, and I would always boast about 
              how sweet it is that both our Chinese names have the same acronyms, 
              &#8220;z-y-w&#8221;. She is one year younger than I am and we knew 
              each other since high school. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After 
              my graduation, I had to serve in the army for two and a half years. 
              During my Officer course, I had a short overseas training in Taiwan. 
              When I called Ziying on my first day there, I found out that she 
              had not stopped crying since I left. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Her 
              depression lasted through my three weeks in Taiwan and time passed 
              by painfully for both of us. My heart was only at peace when I returned 
              to Singapore.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My 
              next overseas training was in one month&#8217;s time and this coincided 
              with Ziying&#8217;s final exams. I could not bear the thought of 
              her not doing well, as she really wanted to be a doctor. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
              then started thinking of ways to escape the overseas training and 
              finally decided to drink spoilt milk the night before my flight. 
              With food poisoning, I was certain that I would miss the training. 
              </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Three 
              days before my departure, I was at Ziying&#8217;s home when my cell 
              phone rang. &#8220;This is Lieutenant David,&#8221; he said, &#8220;a 
              rare disease just broke out in Brunei camp. Training has been postponed 
              to next month. &#8220;Yes Sir,&#8221; my voice was shaking. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tears 
              rolled down my face, as I shared my joy with Ziying. The timing 
              was just perfect, as I would only leave Singapore after her exams. 
              Isaiah 55 verse 9 reminds me that God&#8217;s ways are higher than 
              my ways and His thoughts than my thoughts. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
              was one of the few Bible verses I could ever remember. On one hand, 
              I regretted not committing the matter to God in prayer. On the other, 
              I was amazed at how much God still loves us even when we did not 
              trust in Him. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After 
              my eventful military career, I came over to good old Penn. In freshman 
              year, it was initially hard for me to make new friends because people 
              had difficulties understanding my accent. It took me a while to 
              convince people that English is my native language.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
              the midst of loneliness, I turned to God and took my first step 
              of faith in GCC. Since then, life has been full of changes.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
              used to pray before going to bed and always end up saying Amen the 
              next morning. I now do my quiet time when I am refreshed in the 
              morning. From family groups and retreats, I met so many wonderful 
              people in this church who are living their lives for God. Many of 
              them are seated among you. I want each of you to know that I will 
              always cherish our friendship. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When 
              I returned to Singapore after a blessed freshman year, my dad came 
              up to me on the first day and said, &#8220;Son, you have changed.&#8221; 
              I was worried. Was he going to scold me for my blond hair or the 
              ear stud that I had? </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He 
              continued, &#8220;You have become more understanding and patient 
              with people.&#8221; I rejoiced. My friends also began to comment 
              that I am more open and willing to share about my life. These changes 
              came as a complete surprise to me. Was this the transformation that 
              &#8220;born again&#8221; Christians experienced? </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When 
              I returned to Penn, I was excited to begin the new semester. Looking 
              back at how I was so blessed in freshman year, I decided to set 
              up a Singaporean and Malaysian family group to help the new freshmen 
              adjust to Penn. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Leading 
              Bible study was a difficult step of faith for me, as I felt I lack 
              the knowledge and the eloquence. However, God reminded me that &#8220;His 
              power is made perfect in my weakness.&#8221; Our family group started 
              really small, at times there were only four people at our meetings. 
              Today, we have sixteen regular members. Amen? </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Each 
              one of them has been a great blessing to me and I am really thankful 
              for their continual support.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For 
              almost five months, I was in a dilemma over my plans for summer 
              last year. During the winter break, I attended the OIL conference 
              and there, God revealed His plans to me. I wanted to look for a 
              summer internship, but</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He 
              led me to short-term missions. I eventually submitted to His will. 
              My trip to Cambodia with GCC last year was a tremendous blessing 
              and a decision I will never regret. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;He 
              is the potter, while I am the clay.&#8221; Indeed, God is always 
              molding and shaping our lives. I thank God for how GCC has transformed 
              me. This is really the church where I grew up as a Christian. When 
              I was young, I kept trying to run away from God. Now, I will only 
              run this race for Him. Thank you. </font></p>
