            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em><strong><img src="http://gracecovenant.net/multimedia/pictures/pow/2005/032705/DSC_0462.JPG" width="458" height="305"></strong></em></font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
              Last year, I was so tired of following the items on the checklist 
              of success and prosperity, such as studying for good grades and 
              kissing up to professors for good recommendation letters. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
              was burnt out from high school, and I was discouraged to be surrounded 
              by students who seemed so much more motivated and driven than I. 
              It seemed like they had what it took to accelerate ahead and succeed, 
              while I would straggle behind, crippled by my half-heartedness. 
              </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
              would lead me to dream and fantasize of all the other things I could 
              be doing, like becoming an animator, a world-class chef, a character 
              designer for Squaresoft video games, a traveling bum, a fashion 
              designer, etc. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then 
              I&#8217;d see where I was, and immediately these dreams, would burst 
              and evaporate, leaving me bitter and soaking in a puddle of self-pity. 
              I&#8217;d be left with the question of why I&#8217;m here pursuing 
              an engineering degree, and not on the path to pursue my one of my 
              dreams.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Growing 
              up with a pessimistic outlook on life, the bitterness struck me 
              hard at this point in my life. I began to feel sorry for myself 
              as I started to see myself as a helpless individual sucked into 
              this system that would mold me, and process me, and spit me out 
              once I have earned society&#8217;s seal of approval. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
              my mind, this system had no concern for the individual as it forced 
              fit the individual to society&#8217;s needs and demands. I hated 
              how my life was so planned out: four years of school, then scramble 
              for a job that I won&#8217;t enjoy, buy a house, buy a car, and 
              then keep working at that unfulfilling job till I die. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
              felt cornered; I hated school, I hated this system, I hated the 
              United States for its greed and its promotion of competition and 
              capitalism, I hated my mom for not sending me to art school, I hated 
              my circumstances - you name it and I probably hated it&#8211; my 
              bitterness had no end. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By 
              this time, I dug myself into a deep hole, and it didn&#8217;t help 
              that for most of my life I&#8217;ve lived trying to repress and 
              bury my emotions. I thought that detaching myself from my heart 
              would prepare me for life and help me breeze by future trials and 
              tribulations and avoid pain altogether. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But 
              the problem was, once I dissociated myself from my emotions, I became 
              insensitive and callous to everything else, to the extent that I 
              didn&#8217;t care much for anything or anybody anymore. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of 
              course I didn&#8217;t really show this; towards my friends and family 
              I behaved the way I was supposed to behave, the way they expected 
              me to behave; I had fun with them, but I can&#8217;t really say 
              that I really cared for them from the bottom of my heart because 
              I had locked it up. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Everything 
              about my relationship with my friends was light-hearted and fun, 
              I could never get myself to really get serious with them because 
              nothing was worth getting serious over.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
              decided to do the same thing with society that I did with my emotions: 
              dissociate myself from society, so that I&#8217;d be immune from 
              its rules because I&#8217;ve decided that I didn&#8217;t belong 
              in a society that was built on an obsession with superficial, meaningless 
              values. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I&#8217;d 
              lift myself up by convincing myself that only I realized a truth 
              that nobody else could see because everybody else had been brainwashed 
              by society. Even on my high horse, I felt empty because I really 
              had nothing inside me to drive me forward. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
              was sort of stuck in one place with nowhere else to go. I was trapped 
              in a room, whose blank walls screamed with emptiness. I had flushed 
              out everything out and I became only a shell of a person. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now 
              I stand before you, with a new, more optimistic outlook, the once 
              self-devouring emptiness is now filled with God&#8217;s love. I&#8217;m 
              still amazed that I&#8217;ve made it out, and I know I had nothing 
              to do with this: it was God who rescued me from myself. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
              can&#8217;t pinpoint the exact moment my attitude changed because 
              it happened gradually over time. I stubbornly resisted him at first, 
              but my attempts were weak and feeble compared to his might and power. 
              Soon he was able to break me, and humble me. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He 
              worked in me through the people who had invested their time in me, 
              through prayers, through his words, through sermons, through lectures 
              in class, and even through the media. I realized what I had become, 
              and I realized it was I who had been constricting myself, and not 
              society because it was I who closed off options that were always 
              available to me. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
              just needed to stop complaining, and see things for what they really 
              are. I had to stop and think about God&#8217;s ultimate sacrifice 
              of Jesus Christ, his one and only son. Jesus, who had to suffered 
              so much for me&#8211; he didn&#8217;t die in the middle of flogging, 
              or while he was carrying the cross up to the hill; he went all the 
              way and suffered but all of it. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He 
              didn&#8217;t flake out on us, and it&#8217;s this kind of unconditional, 
              incomprehensible sort of love that saved me. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What 
              was I complaining about? All I need is his love to live. Not only 
              has he poured forth his unending love, he blessed me with so many 
              other things. Ultimately, I realized that He has brought me this 
              far, even when I had ignored Him, and He&#8217;ll continue to lead 
              me in the right direction. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He 
              has been taking care of me, loving me, and most importantly, he 
              had saved me from my sins with the sacrifice of Jesus. That sort 
              of commitment is and never will be of man, but only of God. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Because 
              of this I will try to live my life fearing him and keeping his commandments, 
              for it is my duty as a servant of him who is worthy of my love and 
              so much more.</font></p>
