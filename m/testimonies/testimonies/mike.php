    <td><h4>Testimonies of Christ - Michael Choe</h4>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My 
              name is Michael Choe. I am currently a Commercial Real Estate agent 
              working for Legend Properties. God has changed my life by giving 
              me freedom through Christ from bondage of sin. I tried in vain to 
              find self-worth in my abilities, appearance, athleticism, accomplishments, 
              and in people&#8217;s perceptions. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Two 
              verses that stick close to my heart are Psalm 139:13-14, &#8220;for 
              you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother's 
              womb. I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; 
              your works are wonderful, I know that full well&#8221; and Genesis 
              1:27, &#8220;God created man in his own image, in the image of God 
              he created him.&#8221; God has taught me that I have immense worth 
              that&#8217;s derived from him.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
              In junior and high school, I was a short kid with many insecurities. 
              In order to prove my worth, I placed my efforts in my studies, athletics, 
              and my appearance. I felt that I could find worth and overcome any 
              insecurities by exerting effort to change myself. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
              looked up to people that were smarter, taller, and more athletic. 
              I thought that if I was just a few inches taller, more athletic, 
              a little bit smarter, I would find self-worth. Instead of finding 
              self-worth, this led me into a cycle of bondage. I wasn&#8217;t 
              free because I didn&#8217;t love myself. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My 
              friends and even my family couldn&#8217;t change the way I thought 
              about myself nor could they really understand what I was going through. 
              No matter how much I tried to improve my appearance, improve the 
              way people perceived me, or achieve more, there was always something 
              I could improve or achieve. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
              felt chained and without worth. This all changed when I met a Christian 
              who revealed to me a God that loved me, knew me, created me, accepted 
              me, and died for me. I met this Christian in a Cafeteria where he 
              was debating about God with a friend. The unbeliever threw hard 
              questions of why and how it is possible that Jesus is the only way 
              to eternal life. She questioned this with much unbelief, pointing 
              to the hundreds of beliefs that existed in the world. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
              Christian answered by pointing to a God that loved man so much that 
              he would give up his Son, Jesus Christ as an atoning sacrifice for 
              the sins of man. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He 
              said there was no religion nor spirituality that would offer this 
              kind of relationship with God nor was there any religion that would 
              offer God&#8217;s Son as a sacrifice because he loved man so much. 
              As I thought about his response, I saw a life of integrity, peace, 
              and joy behind such words. I wanted to know more about a God that 
              would sacrifice his Son because he loved me. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A 
              few weeks later, he invited me to his church and I joined his youth 
              group. I felt a warm feeling of love and acceptance amongst the 
              church members. I also saw an inner joy and an inner peace in each 
              member. Coming to such a warm church stirred my curiosity more. 
              This eventually led me to attend a retreat where I was challenged 
              by a message to repent of my sins and turn to God. The Pastor invited 
              the audience to take that step of faith to believe and allow God 
              to be Lord and Savior of their lives. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
              wanted to believe in this Jesus and knew that I had nothing to lose. 
              If he wasn&#8217;t God I would soon find out, but if he was God, 
              then I knew that the bible was true, God loved me and sent his Son, 
              Jesus Christ to die for my sins. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hence, 
              I asked God to enter my heart. Although I didn&#8217;t feel any 
              different nor was my life instantly changed, I sensed a freedom 
              like I never experienced before. I no longer felt the need to prove 
              or earn self-worth but found freedom understanding that God created 
              and loved me. This inspired me to know Jesus more.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
              As I sought Jesus, he proved himself true. I remember my first few 
              years in college I encountered academic difficulty. I needed God 
              and so prayed to him asking him for wisdom and guidance. He reminded 
              me again and again that he loved me and created me. He told me to 
              trust in him and to not let my circumstances deter me in my relationship 
              with him. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Throughout 
              this time, as I sought God, he gave me inner joy and inner peace, 
              provided friendships, and gave me courage reminding me that I was 
              his beloved, fearfully and wonderfully created by him. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another 
              issue was isolation myself away from people due to the fear that 
              I would be rejected and persecuted because of my beliefs. Thus, 
              I began to isolate myself. I again was reminded that God created 
              me, that I need not fear man but God. I was reminded again that 
              self-worth was not based on people&#8217;s perceptions of me but 
              in God himself. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It&#8217;s 
              amazing to see the changes in me before I accepted Christ until 
              now. People, who knew me before I was a Christian, knew I was timid, 
              shy, and very insecure. I couldn&#8217;t love myself and thus, I 
              couldn&#8217;t love people. I was in spiritual bondage, trying to 
              find self-worth through my achievements, appearance, studies, athletics, 
              and people&#8217;s perceptions. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">God 
              freed me from this bondage by reminding me that he loves providing 
              inner peace, and inner joy. He has given me much courage to share 
              his love to people. I have experienced a God faithful to love, embrace, 
              listen, and accept just the way I am. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
              is my desire and joy to share with others the freedom and love I 
              have found in Christ, a love so strong that God would sacrifice 
              his own Son for the sins of man.</font></p>
