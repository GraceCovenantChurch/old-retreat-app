          <td><p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As 
              long as I can remember, I have always been worried. Worried about 
              my life, what people thought of my successes, failures, and me, 
              and my family. I grew up in a home that was not very &#8220;Christian.&#8221; 
              I am the oldest son in a Chinese family, which immediately places 
              the stress to succeed into my life. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My 
              father was also very verbally abusive towards my family. My sisters 
              and I constantly fought over money and the littlest things in life. 
              I took my mother for granted and made her my slave. Even though 
              I went to church all my life I never followed anything from the 
              Bible. My life was my life. I lived a life that was supposed to 
              please me. Life was a competition and struggle, and I was determined 
              to stand out on top.. <br>
              <br>
              I reached a very low point in my life around 16. The stress of worrying 
              completely dominated my days and nights. I spent many sleepless 
              nights thinking: &#8220;Would I get into a good college? Will I 
              become the great doctor that is looked upon with prestige? Will 
              my mother divorce my father? Will life collapse on me?&#8221; One 
              day out of complete frustration, I cried to God, asking Him what 
              I should do. <br>
              <br>
              A pastor once told me that he hated new looking Bibles, because 
              it shows that no one has read them. Well the Bible I received certainly 
              looked pretty new for an age of 8 years. For the first time in my 
              life, I decided to open the Bible and read it, thinking that perhaps 
              the answers lied in there. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
              had found answers no where else. Science provided no answers for 
              me on how to save my family and get me into college. Friends had 
              always failed my expectations. Nothing was left to depend on, but 
              this book I had received when I was a child.<br>
              <br>
              The passage that changed my life was in Matthew 6: 25-34. Jesus 
              talks to the people telling them not to worry. WHAT? For the first 
              time in my life, something had finally pointed out my problem. No 
              one else knew what I was going through, and here was a passage that 
              completely understood my problems. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
              line that struck me the hardest was this, &#8220;So do not worry, 
              saying, &#8220;What shall we eat? or &#8220;What shall we wear?&#8221; 
              For pagans run after all these things, an your heavenly Father know 
              that you need them.&#8221; I finally found out that I was no better 
              than anyone else, constantly living for my own selfish purpose. 
              All I did in my life was ask the question, &#8220;What shall I do?&#8221; 
              God replied back with the line, &#8220;But seek first His kingdom 
              and His righteousness, and all these things will be given to you 
              as well.&#8221; <br>
              <br>
              From Matthew 6: 25-34, I learned everything I needed to about who 
              this &#8220;God&#8221; was. I learn God loves me and that He will 
              take care of me, through anything and everything. After reading 
              this passage, I felt a tugging at my heart to explore other parts 
              of the Bible. Everything Jesus said was amazing! I had never heard 
              anyone tell me to love my enemies, that hate was murder in itself, 
              and that I should treat everyone I meet as if they were my master 
              and I the servant.<br>
              <br>
              I did not become a Christian at that point in my life, but this 
              is the origin of how I came to learn about Christ. When I finally 
              accepted Christ into my life at the age of 17, life started to change. 
              I still go through the tremendous struggles that I go through everyday. 
              </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sometimes 
              life is rougher being a Christian. But, I found life to be so much 
              more joyful than what it was 4 years ago. Christ took away my burdens 
              and my sins so that I would focus on loving Him, instead of worrying 
              about my life. When I learned to love Him more, I learned to love 
              others more than I could ever imagine. I learned to trust in Him, 
              and when I did, God changed my life.<br>
              <br>
              I no longer regard my mother as the slave I treated her as. I love 
              her so much now because I realize God provided me with such a wonderful 
              person. My sisters and I no longer fight either (they became Christians 
              as well). We communicate well now and treat each other with the 
              same love Christ showed us.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
              I have every reason to hate my father. He is one of the reasons 
              why I was so worried about my life and he was the one that was tearing 
              my family apart. I have no hate for him, but grateful love, because 
              I know that God is in control. I constantly pray for him every night 
              that he would love Christ, as I have, so that he may have joy. My 
              life, though constant in struggles, is a life of fulfillment now. 
              I no longer view life as the &#8220;survival of the fittest,&#8221; 
              but a continuous search for the lost people who do not know Christ. 
              <br>
              <br>
              I no longer live for my own selfish purposes, I live for Christ 
              because Christ died for me. I can never pay Christ back for changing 
              my life, but I will live for him from now on. I still worry on occasions 
              because I am not perfect. But God is so good in reminding me that 
              He is in control of my life that I have nothing to fear.<br>
              <br>
              On a less serious note, I wanted to relate a quick story to you. 
              I went home for vacation after school was over a couple of months 
              ago. My little sister, a Christian now, insisted I visit her new 
              church. So one day I went for a visit. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An 
              old friend of mine from high school was there. When he saw me we 
              started talking a little. What was amazing was that at the end of 
              our conversation, he proclaimed to me, &#8220;Jason, you are so 
              relaxed now, what happened to you? You use to be so worried and 
              stressed that I could feel it from you every time I talked to you. 
              Now you look so much better, what happened?&#8221; <br>
              <br>
              With that in mind, I thank you for your time. I want to leave the 
              challenge of reading the Bible up to you. I read it as a non-Christian 
              and it changed my life completely. If anyone of you out there is 
              a believer, please lift up some prayers for my father. I hope that 
              your search for true joy takes you to where I end up, in the arms 
              of Christ. </font></p>
