    <td><h4>Testimonies of Christ - Ange Wang</h4>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When 
              I was six years old, my mom and I left China to join my dad in Kansas, 
              and as an immigrant family, we faced many struggles. Through every 
              difficulty, my parents were wonderful, but also very practical, 
              and there was never any spirituality in our household. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
              ended up going to high school in a nice Los Angeles suburb, and 
              that was when I first seriously thought about God. I decided that 
              He did exist and therefore I was a Christian, but I had no comprehension 
              of what that really meant. And in high school, I also never really 
              saw the need for Christ in my comfortable life.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
              When it was time for college, I had a really hard time choosing 
              between Penn and Pomona College, a small school back home. Finally, 
              after a last-minute visit, I decided on Penn, and though I was uncertain, 
              I imagined that college would be fun and easy.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
              But within a day of being here, I was already so homesick. I wasn&#8217;t 
              used to the lifestyle, the classes, and most of all, just some of 
              the people I met. More than anything, I just felt such a profound 
              sense of loneliness. I regretted my decision. <br>
              <br>
              I felt like I had lost my self confidence and my capacity for happiness. 
              When I took naps to escape from Penn, I just hoped that I would 
              be anywhere else in the world when I woke up.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
              In September I also went to church for the first time. I had gone 
              to GCC intro night, but the first few weeks I was caught up in my 
              own struggles and not thinking about God at all. But one Saturday 
              night I stayed over with a very good friend. <br>
              <br>
              She took me to church the next day, and just the strange peace it 
              gave me was enough to bring me back every week after that. Later, 
              at someone else&#8217;s suggestion, I joined a family group.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
              I had never gone to church at home, so I found it to be very intense, 
              and some things were confusing to me. But through Sunday services, 
              family group, quiet times, and reading the word on my own, I gradually 
              learned more and more about being what being a Christian meant. 
              But, I still felt hesitant about really giving my life up to Jesus.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
              Then the GCC Congregational Retreat came around, which I had been 
              looking forward to so much. The whole weekend was very blessing, 
              but in particular Saturday night during prayer. At one point, all 
              the freshmen stood with our eyes closed, and one of the pastors 
              prayed for me. I still don&#8217;t know who it was. <br>
              <br>
              The pastor asked God to show me how valuable I am to Him. And I 
              remember so clearly that at as he said those words, I knew without 
              a doubt that there was no greater love than God&#8217;s love, that 
              there was nothing else worth living for. And though had I believed 
              before then, that is the moment when I truly accepted Jesus Christ.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
              In searching for a miracle, I don&#8217;t need to look further than 
              my own life. Despite where I was born, the places I&#8217;ve lived, 
              the things I&#8217;ve done, God has been guiding me to Him all along 
              so that I could be saved. And I would be so lost without that grace.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
              Now I feel like my life is so different and so wonderful. God has 
              given me all the peace and love I need, as well as a desire to strive 
              towards Him. I honestly feel like he teaches me something new every 
              day, and my friendships and faith have deepened so much in the last 
              few months. <br>
              <br>
              Of course, I still struggle with sins, as well as problems like 
              trying to reach my parents. But the difference now is that I am 
              not afraid because God&#8217;s presence makes these challenges not 
              so much burdens, but more as opportunities for the miracles and 
              grace that I know He will provide. <br>
              <br>
              And I am so grateful that no matter what I have had to go through 
              to get to this point, that today I can tell about the love of Christ 
              that I now have in my life. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As 
              Romans Chapter 8 says, &#8220;For I am convinced that neither death 
              nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the 
              future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else 
              in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God 
              that is Christ Jesus our Lord.&#8221;</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
              Thank you for letting me share my testimony.</font></p>
