          <td><p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My 
              name is Jason Rotunno. I do computer work at the Hospital here at 
              Penn and I want to share a little bit about how God has used some 
              situations and circumstances in my life to bring me to accept Him 
              which happened about 2 &frac12; years ago. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
              high school I didn&#8217;t think a whole lot about God. I was pretty 
              sure He existed, but I didn&#8217;t really know Him. Throughout 
              college, though, and especially after college my doubts about Him 
              began to grow and my view of Christianity became more negative. 
              I figured that anyone who was even a little bit intellectual could 
              see that Christianity was flawed, contradictory, scientifically 
              inaccurate and fictitious. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
              saw Christians as weak, arrogant, close-minded and hypocritical. 
              I wasn&#8217;t angry or bitter towards Christianity or Christians, 
              but I did see many flaws. I would sometimes wonder about God and 
              about Jesus and figured Christianity was one of man&#8217;s ways 
              of trying to explain His possible existence. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
              imagined that Jesus was an actual man with great teachings, but 
              I had some problems accepting that He was the Son of God. One thought 
              I had was that He had some mental instabilities and thought He was 
              the Son of God. Another was that his claims of being God&#8217;s 
              Son were fictitious additions to his biography. I also attributed 
              legend as a possible explanation to the miracle stories about Him. 
              </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During 
              Christmas when my family got together my uncle would always bring 
              up Jesus. Me and my cousins would look at each other, smirk and 
              roll our eyes. I would sometimes debate with him, but I always held 
              back because&#8230;Well, basically &#8211; I didn&#8217;t want to 
              prove him wrong. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
              felt that his religion helped him a lot so I felt bad forcing the 
              truth upon him. Being that many of my arguments were scientifically 
              based one year he gave me a book which he thought would help me 
              with this area. I promised him I&#8217;d read it and promptly filed 
              it away on my bookshelf when I got home.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">God 
              eventually put me in some situations, though, which brought me to 
              Him. After college I didn&#8217;t enjoy my job and I never really 
              liked Philadelphia so I decided to move to New York. Since Manhattan 
              was too expensive I ended up moving to Jersey City which is right 
              across the Hudson River from Manhattan, but during my year there 
              things didn&#8217;t really work out. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
              didn&#8217;t like Jersey City, I hated spending so much time on 
              the subways to and from work and I wasn&#8217;t making any friends. 
              </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Towards 
              the end of the year I struggled with the decision of whether to 
              move back to Philly. This ended up being one of the hardest decisions 
              I&#8217;ve ever had to make. I was totally torn apart inside and 
              could not figure out what I should do. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
              really agonized over the decision and prayed to God that He would 
              help me make the right one. I finally decided to follow my original 
              plans and came back to Philly returning to my old job. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When 
              I got back, though I couldn&#8217;t believe that&#8217;s the decision 
              that I made. All the reasons that I left Philadelphia came flooding 
              back. The first few months back at my old job I couldn&#8217;t believe 
              I was sitting back in that office. I felt like I&#8217;d taken a 
              step back in my life. I had finally gotten out of the city I wanted 
              to leave for so long only to end up back here.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But 
              God had answered my previous prayers and brought me back to Philadelphia 
              and my old job for a reason. The clinic that I worked in ended up 
              hiring someone who I became friends with. She came to GCC and would 
              share the gospel with me from time to time, but I heard it all before 
              and took it with a grain of salt. Sometimes I would debate with 
              her a bit but like with my uncle I didn&#8217;t want to force the 
              truth on her. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">She 
              invited me to GCC a couple times, but I was hesitant to come. I 
              eventually &#8216;gave in&#8217; and decided to check it out. I 
              was actually really surprised with the service. The message was 
              well presented and one thing that really surprised me is that everyone 
              seemed normal! After the service I felt that there was something 
              to this and it wasn&#8217;t something I could just ignore. However, 
              I was still a little resistant. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
              decided to pull out the book that my uncle had given me a couple 
              years prior. It took some time and some set backs but I slowly began 
              to see the truthfulness of the gospel. I saw that my assumptions 
              and arguments against Christianity had been flawed. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
              realized that Jesus was in fact the Son of God and even though I&#8217;ve 
              sinned against Him, ignored Him, rebelled against Him and did many 
              wrong-doings against him, He still died for me because He wants 
              me to be with Him. I knew that this wasn&#8217;t something that 
              I could acknowledge intellectually without acknowledging spiritually 
              so I accepted Christ into my life.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since 
              then God has changed me in a number of ways. He&#8217;s definitely 
              toned me down. He&#8217;s curbed my urge to curse. To go out partying 
              and drinking. He&#8217;s definitely humbled me as well and I&#8217;m 
              more open to people who I would of otherwise ignored. I see things 
              such as life and death differently, as well. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Overall, 
              God has really opened my heart and my mind so that now I can see 
              the big picture. He&#8217;s turned my focus from myself to Him. 
              I thank the Lord that He provided me a way back to Him and put Himself 
              in my path.</font></p>
