          <td><p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hi! 
              My name is Jing Ai, and I am a sophomore at Penn studying Management 
              and Technology. Today, I am here because I want to share about how 
              Jesus came into my life, and I want to declare before all of you 
              that Jesus Christ is my Savior and my Lord. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
              was born in a nonreligious family in China. Marxist philosophy is 
              very pervasive in China and I was taught that believing in God was 
              superstitious, and that everyone should just be self-reliant. I 
              believed that there was no God, and that people&#8217;s future is 
              within their own control. <br>
              <br>
              However, during my last two years of high school, I started wondering 
              whether the worldview of China was the right one. After all, I had 
              never heard views from outside of China. All of the media was under 
              government control. So, I started thinking about coming to United 
              States for my education. Although my parents wanted me to stay in 
              China, when I got the acceptance letter to Penn, they allowed me 
              to go study in America. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When 
              I first got here as a freshman, I was very confused. I did not even 
              know what a quarter or dime was when I was trying to use the laundry 
              machine. I felt like I was trapped in a maze, but still believed 
              that I should be self-reliant, just as I was taught in China.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During 
              the first few weeks, I met some friends who invited me to their 
              church. I was really bored. I told myself I would never waste hours 
              like this again. To me, religion was not scientific and could not 
              be logically proven. I thought to myself, &#8220;Why would I come 
              all the way to America to waste time on religion?&#8221;</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
              First semester came and went without me ever thinking about religion 
              again. I just didn&#8217;t care. Second semester began and I just 
              continued with my studies. One night, I was eating dinner by myself 
              in Hill dining, when two girls came and sat next to me. One thing 
              led to another and I asked them how they became Christians. They 
              openly shared their testimonies with me. I thought they were nice 
              stories, but I didn&#8217;t think that would apply to me. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After 
              that, I just kept on running into one of them. We shared more meals 
              together, and when she asked me to come to church with her, I went 
              because I did not want to hurt her feelings. <br>
              <br>
              In the past, I did not even have the patience to listen to stories 
              about Jesus from other people, but since she was my friend, I listened 
              to her. She spent a lot of time patiently explaining the basic concepts 
              of Christianity to me. To make her happy, I just kept going to GCC 
              with her. Even though I did not believe in it, I began to be more 
              open towards religion.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Seeing 
              so many people at church made me wonder what attracted everyone 
              to Jesus Christ. I began to think that maybe religion did have some 
              merit. I kept on going to church because the messages were good; 
              especially the ones by the round &#8211; faced pastor.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Because 
              my friend and I live in the same hall this year, we began to meet 
              once a week to study the Bible together. My friend had explained 
              to me a lot about sin, and how even the good things we did were 
              tainted with sin. <br>
              <br>
              I began to think about it and examine my personal life. Sometimes 
              I felt jealousy or had an unforgiving heart, but I did even more 
              good things. I never thought I was a bad person. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One 
              Friday large group, we had an extended time of prayer. The sermon 
              I remember was about how God loves His people, whether they believed 
              in Him or not. I had thought religion was a way of fooling people 
              and controlling their minds. But the fact that God still loved me 
              despite my hatred towards the concept of God touched me so deeply 
              that I just started crying. <br>
              <br>
              Even though neither I, nor my family, nor my friends believed in 
              Jesus, He still died for our sins. That day, I decided to accept 
              Jesus Christ into my heart. I was very thankful that I could finally 
              see that God was my Savior and Lord. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Having 
              accepted Him into my life, I am changed. I don&#8217;t worry about 
              my future anymore, because I know Jesus is in control. It is easier 
              for me to forgive others more quickly. I understand that my happiness 
              is not a result of circumstances, since Jesus is my inner, constant 
              joy. I am no longer self-reliant, but completely dependent on Jesus. 
              I feel content and secure in Him</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Unlike 
              other religions, Christianity is God coming to men through Jesus 
              Christ offering them a relationship with himself. Christianity gives 
              people the possibility of being loved unconditionally. <br>
              <br>
              This feeling really amazed me, and my belief that Jesus is a living 
              God that saved us became stronger. If it were not true, there would 
              never have been such change in my life. This makes me desire to 
              hold on to the Cross even more.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
              thank God for really coming into my life, offering me the greatest 
              gift of eternal life with Him. My family and my friends back home 
              are still not touched by Christ, but it is my prayer that God would 
              open their hearts, that they would know Jesus as their Savior and 
              Lord. <br>
              <br>
              Please keep them in your prayers, and pray for me that I would learn 
              how to pray, and grow deeper in my relationship with Christ. </font></p>
