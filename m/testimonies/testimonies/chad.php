    <td><h4>Testimonies of Christ - Chad Moyer</h4>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hi, 
              my name is Chad Moyer and I&#8217;m a freshman at Penn. I&#8217;m 
              so incredibly honored to be able to share my story with you this 
              morning, and truly attest to the fact that God is working every 
              day to bring us closer to Him.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My 
              life before Christ was a continual struggle to find the answer to 
              a puzzle that I couldn&#8217;t comprehend. My church back home always 
              taught me that Jesus Christ was my personal Savior, but I never 
              fully understood what that meant; I thought my &#8220;moral image&#8221; 
              was enough to have people think I was holy. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
              thought going to church and Sunday school, using my rationality 
              and perseverance through my struggles was enough to earn my salvation. 
              Internalizing my suffering created this inner sense of bitterness 
              towards many, but I kept a smile on my face and only truly trusted 
              myself. Something was missing. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
              summer before college, I started to hang out more with my neighbor 
              and close friend, who became Christian during her first year at 
              Penn State. Before she was a Christian, I couldn&#8217;t see anything 
              minutely wrong with her, but now she seemed even happier than before. 
              </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Her 
              passion for life and for others was simply overwhelming, and I couldn&#8217;t 
              understand why she had so much faith in a God that I had &#8220;known&#8221; 
              all my life. Why did she seem to coast through life while I struggled 
              so much? I coveted her life, and deep down, suffered even more, 
              frustrated that I couldn&#8217;t experience what she was going through.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
              headed off to college without any expectations knowing full well 
              that I didn&#8217;t need to impress anybody nor would I be judged 
              by anyone. With things changing so rapidly, partying blinded my 
              eyes to the fact that I wasn&#8217;t adjusting as well as I had 
              hoped. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Being 
              a student-athlete at a division one school was an entirely new experience, 
              and quickly I found out that it just added to my struggling whereas 
              before, my love for the sport had helped me deal with them. During 
              the weekdays, my life spiraled out of control, and it seemed to 
              me that the only way to feel better was to go out on the weekends. 
              </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But 
              each Monday morning, I woke up feeling a little more than physically 
              sick. Little did I know that God was using the time in my life when 
              I felt the weakest to make me stronger, and more importantly, bring 
              me closer to Him.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After 
              an incredibly tough week of school and a very crazy night, I woke 
              up feeling surprisingly well one Sunday. I have no idea what compelled 
              me to do so, but I got out of bed, and walked down to DRL by myself: 
              something I would never have done on my own will. I don&#8217;t 
              really remember how I heard about this church or even what time 
              services were at. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During 
              worship that morning, I felt the presence of the Holy Spirit for 
              the first time. Nothing I had experienced on earth could ever compare 
              to it. Pastor Young seemed to preach straight to me, and somehow, 
              God took away all thoughts and memories of my struggles and gave 
              me a taste of His awesome love. The seed was planted, and this curiosity, 
              this hunger for more grew inside of me.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A 
              young adult really reached out to me after service, and I signed 
              up for a family group soon after, but didn&#8217;t really get into 
              it. I remember one day I came back from swim practice and my roommate 
              said that this Asian kid had stopped by. He was going to leave a 
              note, but apparently he just added his name to my buddy list. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
              found out later that it was one of the small group leaders. Why 
              would somebody even care about one kid who showed up twice to family 
              group? The other leaders kept pursuing me, and I was still confused 
              as to why that young adult took the time to talk with me.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
              kept going to church every Sunday, and as I hungered for more, God 
              started giving me more visible signs of his power and mercy. At 
              times, although I might not have seen His purpose immediately, God 
              was using every moment to bring me even closer. This past winter, 
              I decided hesitantly to miss most of my winter break and go to Florida 
              to train with the team. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
              regretted my decision so much because I would have to sacrifice 
              those two or three weeks of time with my family. We were planning 
              on training for about five hours each day, and my anxiety continued 
              to grow past the point of worry. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
              was anxious about logistics, my relationships with other team members, 
              and just having the strength to get through the training. But this 
              trip showed me that God is so much bigger than my worries here on 
              earth &#8211; I felt strangely comfortable in this new environment, 
              I grew very close to my roommates, and His strength was more than 
              enough to get me through the strenuous practices. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Before 
              that trip, swimming had drawn me so far away from God by adding 
              to my bitterness towards some people on the team, and from just 
              an overall dislike of the sport here at Penn. I realized through 
              this week that He has control over everything, and it became so 
              clear that the one person I can always trust is God.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although 
              I had decided to put all my trust in the Lord, I was still living 
              a life in the world, and one night in January, I realized that a 
              relationship with Christ is all or nothing. God revealed to me the 
              things that I was still holding onto. 1st John 2:17 says, &#8220;The 
              world and its desires pass away, but the man who does the will of 
              God lives forever.&#8221; </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Also 
              from Luke 9: verse 23, &#8220;Then he said to them all: &#8220;If 
              anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his 
              cross daily and follow me. For whoever wants to save his life will 
              lose it, but whoever loses his life for me will save it.&#8221;&#8221; 
              I&#8217;ll be the first to admit that it was tough giving up the 
              things of this world, but the hope I have in Jesus Christ is far 
              greater than anything this world could ever give me.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By 
              no means am I perfect, and I still have my struggles, but through 
              a personal relationship with Him, I know that I have hope of a better 
              day, when this world has faded to dust, and I can walk hand-in-hand 
              with my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. God has continually changed 
              me over the past few months after I dedicated my life to Christ, 
              and I&#8217;ve realized that there is never an end to His awesome 
              power and love. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He&#8217;s 
              given me a passion for the lost, an incredible sense of joy, and 
              has even begun to use my story to help witness to my non-Christian 
              friends. I have a profound sense of respect for those of you who&#8217;ve 
              never strayed far from the path, but it was during these times of 
              struggle that God revealed himself to me, and I will never forget 
              how it felt to live without Jesus. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Matthew 
              5:14-16 says, &quot;You are the light of the world. A city on a 
              hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it 
              under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light 
              to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light shine 
              before men, that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father 
              in heaven.&#8221; </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I&#8217;m 
              not afraid to tell the world the Good News, and I stand before you 
              this Easter morning as a living testimony that Jesus Christ has 
              risen!</font></p>
