              OF CHRIST - BONING LI</em></font></strong></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My 
              name is Boning Li and I am a freshman at Penn. My major is Chemical 
              and Biomolecular Engineering. I live in the suburbs of New Jersey 
              with my parents, my grandma, and my five year old sister.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
              I have always had this plan for my life.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
              One, I was going to do really well in school and get a really good 
              job that paid enough so I can live very comfortably and still do 
              all the fun stuff people with money do on television.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
              Two, I was going to fall in love.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
              I didn&#8217;t think these were too much to ask for. I had my life 
              goal planned. Everything was going to be okay.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
              With these goals in mind, I started high school as an optimistic 
              freshman. I didn&#8217;t drink or smoke&#8212;I considered myself 
              to be a good daughter, friend, and student. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But 
              when I look back in the journals that I wrote in, I realized I was 
              so very bitter and depressed. Even though I was blessed with loving 
              parents, an education most people aren&#8217;t able to afford, I 
              was constantly sad, and I felt empty. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
              didn&#8217;t know why. I was constantly jealous of others who had 
              more than me or seemed happier than me; I was extremely goal oriented, 
              and it controlled my life. And at the end of the day, I would look 
              at myself and I hated myself so much; I hated the ugliness inside 
              of me. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My 
              New Years Resolution for every year was to change; but under every 
              leaf that I turned, the old one was always there. I didn&#8217;t 
              know what to do than to sometimes cry myself to sleep. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yes, 
              I was a perfectionist and I wanted to die.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
              When I first came to Penn, I was still lost; but I thought I can 
              still hold my battleground. But God had plans for me. I was blessed 
              with a Christian roommate (her name is Ah Rim Shin), but she became 
              more than just a Christian roommate, we became really good friends. 
              </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
              get each others&#8217; jokes&#8212;well, most of the times; if we 
              don&#8217;t, one of us just stares at the other.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
              So she convinced me to go to GCC, and I loved it; it really opened 
              my eyes and dissipated many of my false preconceptions of this religion</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
              For instance, one of the most important thing I learned was that 
              Christianity was not a religion: it was a personal relationship 
              with God</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
              Ah Rim signed up for small group, and so did I. I was blessed with 
              a very kind and warm hearted family group and a really good family 
              group leader; I began to know more of my sisters and brothers and 
              each showed me more of God by sharing their individual take on Christianity 
              with me.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Looking 
              back, I wonder if it was God that carried me? When I felt like I 
              was drowning in darkness, was He that gave me the light to carry 
              on?</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It 
              must have been God or how else did my grandma survive the Cultural 
              Revolution? </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
              must have been God or how else were my parents strong enough to 
              start a life here in America? </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
              must have been God because I could&#8217;ve died a long time ago 
              in China and no one would have cared. It must have been God because 
              I am standing here, breathing now.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I 
              realized none of my goals made any sense any more. When I wanted 
              to do well in school and have a good job application, I just wanted 
              security and approval from my parents and my peers. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Approval 
              from my parents so that they would say &#8220;Hey, look at my daughter, 
              I&#8217;m so proud of her; my sacrificed sweat and blood has paid 
              off&#8221;<br>
              or &#8220; Hey, look at my friend, she is so cool; she&#8217;s got 
              everything going on for her.&#8221;</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> So 
              that at the end of the day, when I look into the mirror, I can feel 
              good about myself and feel like I deserve to live.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> But 
              after hearing the Lord&#8217;s word every Sunday, I realized that 
              the security I seek was already granted to me when I decided to 
              pursue this faith.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> And 
              the most important approval has already been granted to me when 
              God has accepted me as his child and allowed me to enter His Kingdom 
              in Heaven and to walk with him forever.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> And 
              when I wanted to fall in love, I didn&#8217;t realize that God has 
              given me the most precious gift of all&#8212; Him; And I have fallen 
              in love with him ever since the day I realized that He thinks I 
              am more precious than the Universe.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> And, 
              God, I want to fall in love with you more everyday. I feel so free 
              now; and there is peace in my heart. This the way it should&#8217;ve 
              been, and the way it should be.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What 
              truly amazes me is that God has given me His only son so that his 
              blood would cover me, even though I was so undeserving of Him. I 
              was so unworthy, yet He loved me&#8212;all of me. And even though 
              I can&#8217;t be truly perfect for my God, I long to do so because 
              I love Him, too. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I don&#8217;t 
              know what the future might bring or if I will resolve all of my 
              doubts in this faith. But what I do know is that:</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When 
              I think of God<br>
              I feel like a lamb being led by my shepherd, Jesus<br>
              I feel an overwhelming love enveloping me<br>
              I feel like that I have awakened out my darkness<br>
              loving everything and all that is here because He has made everything 
              that is here<br>
              <br>
              God makes me smile<br>
              God gives me the strength to live<br>
              God gives me the faith to believe<br>
              And God gives me the hope to love<br>
              God, thank you so much for the Truth</font></p>
