            <p>Our 
              doors are wide open to people from all backgrounds. Whether you 
              are a spiritual seeker just beginning to ask questions about God 
              or a committed Christian wanting to deepen your faith, Grace Covenant 
              Church is a place you can call home and find spiritual help, hope, 
              and encouragement. Wherever you are in your spiritual journey, we 
              invite you to discover GCC&#8212;and discover for yourself God&#8217;s 
              wonderful love and plan for your life!</p>
            <p>What 
              makes us unique? It isn&#8217;t our beliefs. We affirm the same 
              basic Christian doctrines that have been a part of the Church for 
              hundreds of years. Rather, we are committed to presenting these 
              truths in a practical, relevant, contemporary, and loving manner. 
              Our desire is to introduce you to Jesus Christ and to help you grow 
              and become a kingdom worker. We want to help you to become a kingdom 
              worker who can influence the world around you with the love of Jesus 
              Christ. </p>

            <p>Our 
              church is comprised of a network of &#8220;<a href="/ministries/familygroups.php">family 
              groups</a>&#8221;; small group settings where honest friendships, 
              Bible study, constant prayer, and compassionate care are emphasized. 
              It is within these dynamic family groups where the core of our evangelism 
              and discipleship take place. We invite you to become of a part of 
              these contagious Christian communities that strive to influence 
              and encourage one another.</p>
            <p>Again, 
              whether you&#8217;re a spiritual seeker who&#8217;s just starting 
              to ask questions about God, or a committed Christian who wants to 
              sink the roots of your faith even deeper, you can find a home here 
              at Grace Covenant Church.</p>
