	<li>We are sending missions teams to China and OTR this summer. The China medical missions trip (7/7-7/18) will be ministering to a rural area in southern China and providing medical care as they share the gospel. The OTR trip to Cincinnati (7/12-7/21) will be doing street evangelism, running a youth retreat and school of evangelism, and doing community outreach. To support our brothers and sisters financially, we will be taking a missions offering on June 17th. Please prayerfully support these teams as they prepare and go out to serve as kingdom workers in these places!</li>
