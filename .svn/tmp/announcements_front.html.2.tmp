We will run a Summer Program called "Mighty Minds" starting July 9th - August 29th, Tuesdays and Thursdays from 5:15pm - 7pm. Family groups can also interact with the kids in some creative fashion (like a play day, or leading arts/crafts, etc.) Please contact Aerin Lee (aerin824@gmail.com) if interested in either.</li>
