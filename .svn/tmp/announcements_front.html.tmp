    We will meet at Meyerson B1 at 7:30pm and then split into seminars
<ul>
    <li>P. Kirt &amp; MeiLan: Inner Healing
    <ul><li>Past wounds that never heal wound us and others. Subconsciously and consciously we bury them and think "I'm OK".  But our behavior, personality, and words say otherwise.  Jesus tells us in John 10:10 "The thief comes to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that you may have life, and have it to the full."  Learn how Jesus wants to break you free and give you life.
    </li></ul>
    </li>
    <li>P. Yohan &amp; Mandie: God's Purpose in Work
    <ul><li>The average American will spend almost 100,000 hours of his life working. Question: How can the Christian redeem these hours as worship? (We will talk about more than workplace evangelism)</li></ul>
    </li>
    <li>P. Young &amp; Annette: The Road to Biblical Marriage
    <ul><li>What can you do to prepare for marriage? How do you pray for it? What are pitfalls to avoid? What can you do now to make your future marriage stronger? </li></ul>
    </li>
    <li>P. Joe &amp; Hanna: Our Identity in Christ
    <ul><li>(Romans 5:1 Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ) Why do so many Christians still live as though they are under bondage even though they belong to God? In John 8:36, Jesus tells us that "if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed." Without proper understanding of our Identity in Christ, people will end up living in frustration and under bondage. As we understand our Identity in Christ, we are able to walk in victory that is already ours in Christ Jesus.</li></ul>
