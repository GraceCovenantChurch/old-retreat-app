      <p>We, at Grace Covenant Church, are organizing a 3-on-3 Basketball Fundraiser to be held on Saturday, May 26th in the northern suburbs of Philadelphia. The goal of this event is to help raise awareness, prayer, and funds towards a specific Gospel-centric cause on an annual basis.</p>

<p>In addition to the basketball tournament, we plan to have several mini-events and games geared towards children, short presentations by local Christian music artists, and an announcement of total funds raised at the end of the day.</p>
