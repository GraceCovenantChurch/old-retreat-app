			"<ol>",
"<li>As you look at the first five verses, put yourself in the scene as if in a movie: Who is there?  What sounds do you hear?  What are your visual impressions?</li>",
"<li>What request does Jesus make of Peter?  What is Peter's reaction, and why does he react this way?</li>",
"<li>What happens after Peter complies with Jesus's request, and how does it affect Peter?  (Read Isaiah 6:1-8.  What is Isaiah's response to the holiness of God?  How is this similar to Peter's?)</li>",
"<li>If you were one of these three fishermen, what characteristics of Jesus would lead you to leave everything to follow him?  </li>",
"<li>What does it really mean to follow Jesus?  Is there anything holding you back from freely following Jesus?</li>",
"</ol>",
			"</p>",
			"<br><br>",
			"<p><b>--- SUNDAY DEVOTIONAL - Luke 8:40-55 ---</b><br>",
                        "<ol>",
"<li>According to verses 46-48, how does Jesus know that someone had touched him?  Why does he insist that the woman come forward?</li>",
"<li>What happens because of the 'delay' from healing the woman?  If you were Jairus, how would you feel in such a situation?</li>",
"<li>In verses 51-56, what does Jesus do when he arrives at the home of Jairus? What do these verses reveal about Jesus?</li>",
"<li>Compare and contrast these two encounters with Jesus.  What do you learn about faith in Jesus, and how does this apply to you?</li>",
"<li>Spend some time in prayer reflecting on what you have learned about Jesus in this passage.</li>",
                        "</ol",
