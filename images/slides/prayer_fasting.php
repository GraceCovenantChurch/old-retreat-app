	<p>As a church we will be starting off 2011 with a 21-day Fasting and
Prayer Campaign.  We will be doing a Lent-like fast for 21 days to
start off the New Year with an attitude of refocusing and renewing our
hearts to Jesus Christ.  The staff will be fasting from meat and doing
a juice fast for the last week with a complete fast on the last day,
January 21st.   In addition to fasting, we will be posting a daily
devotional to the website/facebook to keep us centered in the Word as
well.  We definitely want to encourage all of GCC to join us in this
fasting and prayer campaign as well.  We think it will be a great way
for us all to dedicate the New Year to the Lord and to experience
greater breakthrough in our lives and in our church's ministry.
</p>

	<p>This Fasting and Prayer Campaign will coincide with three events.
First, we'll kick it off with the New Year's Eve Service (Dec 31st,
10:30pm at St. Paul's Lutheran Church), then we'll have a GCC-wide
prayer meeting on Friday January 14th (7:30pm at Meyerson Hall in the
UC), and we will end the campaign after the FNL prayer meeting on
January 21st (7:30pm at DRL).</p>

	<p>Here are some suggestions for observing this Fasting and Prayer Campaign:</p>
	<ol>
	    <li>Try to intensify your commitment to God within this time period.
Commit to read the Word and spend time in prayer.</li>
        <li>Try to “fast” from something.  Keep in mind that it should cost us
something.  What I mean by “cost” is this:  If you are not a breakfast
eater, fasting from breakfast will not cost you anything.  Try to fast
from something you know that at times will challenge you.  Here are
some examples:
			<ul>
                <li>Fast from TV or video games</li>
				<li>Fast from chocolates or coffee</li>
				<li>Fast from going out to restaurants</li>
				<li>Fast from studying on Sundays (b/c you are diligent in getting
everything done from M-Sat)</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>Also there are some things to remember in the midst of fasting:</p>
	<ol>
	    <li>Remember not to judge.  Don’t look down on people who are not
actively fasting with us.  Remember it does not make you more
spiritual.  If we are not careful it can lead to spiritual pride.</li>
        <li>Remember not to get discouraged.  If you fail, pick yourself up and
try again.  Though a righteous man falls seven times, he rises again
(Proverbs 24:16)</li>
		<li>Remember to focus on Jesus.  It is all about what Christ did for us
on the cross.  May we never forget!</li>
	</ol>
