      <h4>Prayer Focus - The Liu Family - September 30, 2007</h4>
      <p>In the summer of 2005, Pastor Paul, Ailsa, and their daughter Caitlyn departed the U.S. to serve the Lord in Southeast Asia. Pastor Paul and Ailsa were used by God in a variety of ways since the early stages of GCC, and God called them to expand their territory halfway around the world. Praise God for the Lius' obedience to heed the call to go. Despite a rough transition, their ministry is flourishing. Let's pray that they feel our prayers in a very difficult culture.</p>
      <p>
	<b>Prayer Requests:</b>
	<ul>
	  <li>Furlough: The Lius are back in the United States for a few weeks.  Pray for a good time of rest and renewal with family and friends.</li>
	  <li>Ministry opportunities: Pray for open doors to share the Gospel message despite the negative cultural climate.</li>
	  <li>Church plant: The church was planted over a year ago and has been growing. Pray for perseverance for Pastor Paul and Ailsa, that they would continue to be faithful</li>
	  <li>Co-Laborers: As they continue their ministry, pray that God brings native workers to help build and spread the Gospel.</li>
	</ul>
