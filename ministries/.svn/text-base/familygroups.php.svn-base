      <h4>Family Groups</h4><br>

      <p>At GCC we place a high emphasis on Family Groups because we believe that 
	it is in these smaller settings that we are able to meet with God,
	building meaningful relationships, and develop biblical 
	accountability. Family groups meet on a weekly basis at various places.</p>

      <p>Through Bible study, discussions, sharing and prayer, we learn to
	live out the teachings of the Bible in our daily lives. You are
	strongly encouraged to join a family group that fits your needs,
	interests and life situation.</p>
      
      <p>Family groups are divided between the Harvest (undergraduate) and Crossroad (post-college) groups.</p>
