	  <p><b>Privileges:</b> 
	    The goal of the Grace Covenant Church Missions Committee
	    is to build up the church's heart for cross-cultural Christian 
	    service.  There are three primary responsibilities the committee 
	    assumes.  The first is to plan and administer the Missions Workshops, 
	    which provide theological and practical information on the realm of 
	    cross-cultural service.  The second is to support the full-time 
	    missionaries that GCC sends out and sponsors through prayer and 
	    financial contributions.  The third is to manage the church's 
	    short-term summer missions program.  This also includes the 
	    responsibility of sending out and supporting the short-term teams 
	    each year.   
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The Missions Committee is structured with two units: the long-term 
	    group and the short-term group.  The administration of the 
	    Missions Workshops is a joint effort between both units.</p>
