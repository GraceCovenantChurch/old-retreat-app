                          <p align="left">The 
                            conflict in Kashmir began after India gained independence 
                            from Britain in 1947. The subcontinent then separated 
                            itself into the Muslim nation of Pakistan and the 
                            Hindu nation of India. The separation was followed 
                            by intense rioting and a massive 2-way migration as 
                            Muslims and Hindus hurried to be within the correct 
                            country. Half a million people died in the conflict 
                            and a million more lost their homes.</p>
                          <p align="left">The 
                            rivarly between Pakistan and India has its roots in 
                            history and cultural differences. This rivalry is 
                            especially evident in their fight to control the province 
                            of Kashmir. During the separation, the Maharaja of 
                            Kashmir joined India in exchange for military aid 
                            and a promised referendum. However, since the majority 
                            of the state's population, concentrated in the valley 
                            of Kashmir, is Muslim, Pakistanis still believe today 
                            that these states rightfully belong to Pakistan. Now 
                            both countries occupy sectors of the land and constantly 
                            fight over its division. Also, a violent movement 
                            for a completely independent Kashmir state arose in 
                            1989, adding a third dimension to the conflict.</p>
                          <p align="left">Last 
                            year, India and Pakistan began to open peace talks 
                            after teetering on the brink of nuclear war. However 
                            tension arose again when the Kashmiri guerilla groups 
                            began a campaign of terror in Kashmir as well as other 
                            parts of India. The latest blast was on August 25th 
                            in Bombay, India&#8217;s economic and entertainment 
                            center. India blames Pakistan for allegedly backing 
                            the militant groups and supporting such attacks. While 
                            Pakistan refuses to control such groups, India will 
                            not participate in talks. Pakistan, in turn, will 
                            not talk unless India compromises on the Kashmir issue. 
                            Until leaders settle the dispute, soldiers from all 
                            sides wage a daily guerilla war in Kashmir.</p>

                                Kashmiri People: </strong>They are caught between 
                                an international power struggle that has lasted 
                                decades. Much of the fighting is unpredictable 
                                and happens right in their own neighborhoods, 
                                leaving thousands upon thousands homeless. Quality 
                                of life has dramatically decreased this past decade 
                                and many are forced to flee to either Pakistan 
                                or India. Please pray for divine provision for 
                                a people in great need, that God would orchestrate 
                                all circumstances to reveal His glory in such 
                                a difficult situation.<br>

                                Leaders of Pakistan and India</strong>: They are 
                                General Pervez Musharraf and Prime Minister Atal 
                                Behari Vajpayee respectively. The bitterness that 
                                runs between the two countries is deep and will 
                                not likely be settled soon. Please pray for hearts 
                                that desire peace more than pride.</li>
