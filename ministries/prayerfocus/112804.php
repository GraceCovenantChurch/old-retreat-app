                          <p>This week, the US announced that it 
                            will end its peacekeeping mission to Bosnia and will 
                            be replaced by a European Union peacekeeping force 
                            called Eu-for.</p>
                          <p>With the collapse of the socialist 
                            Yugoslavian state in 1991, civil war broke out in 
                            1992 between the Muslims and Croats against the Serbs. 
                            Each had their own political goals and there was in-fighting 
                            in each faction. The Serbs quickly gained control 
                            of the area and imposed ethnic cleansing on the entire 
                            region. About 250,000 died in total due to the conflict. 
                            In 1995, the Dayton Peace Accord was signed, establishing 
                            new rules for government in the area. </p>
