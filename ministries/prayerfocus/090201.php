                          historically has been a busy month for our church. We 
                          are thankful for the opportunity to minister to the 
                          influx of new students (both college and graduate) and 
                          working young professionals. Listed below is a brief 
                          summary of our upcoming events. It is our desire that 
                          the LORD would make Philadelphia a place of tremendous 
                          blessing and spiritual growth for those who are called 
                          to spend extended time here.<br>
