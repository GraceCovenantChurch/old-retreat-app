                        <p align="left">Kyrgyzstan 
                          is a poverty-stricken nation in the mountains of Central 
                          Asia. In its first years of independence from former 
                          Soviet control, it addresses a rapidly growing state 
                          of fundamentalist Islam.</p>
                        <p align="left">During 
                          this initial period of building infrastructure, the 
                          nation faces political vulnerability and lacks a good 
                          response to factions that want to establish a Caliphate 
                          (an Islamic super-state enforcing the Koran in place 
                          of democracy). Though radical, these Islamic movements 
                          claim to be peaceful and nonviolent.</p>

                          <li>The
