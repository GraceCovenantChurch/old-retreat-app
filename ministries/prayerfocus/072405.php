                        <p align="left">Earlier 
                          this month, the G8 summit was held in Scotland. Leaders 
                          of the world&#8217;s richest nations came to discuss, 
                          among other issues, financial aid and debt forgiveness 
                          to Africa and worldwide extreme poverty. One such country 
                          that has pled its case before the global community is 
                          Niger.</p>
                        <p align="left"><img src="niger/niger.png" width="264" height="275" align="right">Niger 
                          is a landlocked nation comprised <br>
                          of mostly dry, hot desert land. Recently, <br>
                          a wave of locusts and a season of drought <br>
                          has completely devastated the already <br>
                          barren country. Out of 11.7 million inhabitants, <br>
                          about 3.6 million people are in desperate <br>
                          starvation, of which 1 million are children. <br>
                          Families are feeding their children grass and <br>
                          leaves to keep them alive. The next harvest <br>
                          is at least still three months away.<br>
                          <br>
                          The 
                          U.N. has appealed for assistance to Niger on several 
                          occasions, with little response. Many of the pledged 
                          donations have yet to arrive. In the last year, the 
                          U.N. has asked for $46 million and received only about 
                          $11 million in response. The international response 
                          to this condition has been woefully insufficient and 
                          without immediate relief, Niger may suffer permanent 
                          damage from severe malnourishment.</p>
