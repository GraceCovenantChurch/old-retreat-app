                          <strong>About The Lee family:</strong><br>
                          For the past few years, GCC has been blessed by guest 
                          visits by Dr. Steve Lee and his powerful messages. He, 
                          his wife Betty, and four children have been preparing 
                          to leave for the missions field for 15 years. </p>
                        <p align="left">In 
                          the meanwhile, Dr Steve has served as interim senior 
                          pastor at Faith Alliance Bible Church for three years 
                          in Chicago. In August of 2004, Dr Steve left for Kenya, 
                          Africa with Africa Inland Mission International (AIM). 
                          AIM is a nondenominational mission organization with 
                          over 850 missionaries in its service and a robust medical 
                          ministry. </p>
                        <p align="left">Dr 
                          Steve will spend the next several months in Africa learning 
                          about the medical practices in a nearby hospital and 
                          studying the Swahili language. The children have been 
                          adapting fairly well and will start being home-schooled 
                          soon.</p>

                          requests for the Lee family: </strong></p>

                            children (Joy, Noelle, Luke, and Bethany): </strong>The 
                            missions field can be an extremely difficult place 
                            for the children of missionaries. Please pray that 
                            God would encourage, protect, and enable them to also 
                            spread the Gospel in Kenya. Also, Betty is now expecting 
                            a 5th child so please pray for safety in delivery.

                            The medical ministry: </strong>With the AIDS crisis 
                            and regional instability, the medical ministry in 
                            Africa is in dire need. Pray that God would make Dr 
                            Steve&#8217;s medical ministry powerful and fruitful 
                            as he starts to practice medicine again.</li>
