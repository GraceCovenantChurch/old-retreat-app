<p>
Typhoon Saomai, the most powerful storm to hit China in five decades, raged ashore Thursday and churned across the crowded southeast, wrecking houses and capsizing ships after 1.5 million residents were evacuated. The death toll has yet to be determined.
<p>
Saomai, dubbed a "super typhoon" by Chinese forecasters due to its huge size and high wind speeds, was the eighth major storm of this year's unusually violent typhoon season. Typhoons and tropical storms are common in the region between July and October, but this year they have been unusually frequent. Damage was expected to be widespread in areas that were still recovering from Tropical Storm Bilis, which claimed more than 600 lives last month.
<p>
<b>Please pray for:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Relief Efforts</b> - Pray for swift relief efforts to reach this region as many are left homeless, without food, water, electricity, etc.</li>
<li><b>Rebuilding Process</b> - Much like the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, currently schools, sports stadiums and theaters have turned into temporary shelters. Pray for the rebuilding process as this region gets back on its feet.</li>
<li><b>Gospel</b> – Pray that the Gospel of Hope and Salvation would reach this region as many deal with this disaster.</li>
</ul>
