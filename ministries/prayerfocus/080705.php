                        <p align="left">Iran 
                          has been devastated with corruption, a war with Iraq, 
                          and economic sanctions. Combined with rapid population 
                          growth, the once-thriving Middle Eastern nation is now 
                          battling poverty and unemployment.</p>
                        <p align="left">In 
                          addition, Iran is politically unstable and returning 
                          to a state of militant behavior. Recently, the EU has 
                          been pushing for an emergency UN nuclear watchdog meeting 
                          because Iran has reinstated the enrichment of plutonium. 
                          The nation wants to continue to develop nuclear power, 
                          but it has been accused of wanting to develop nuclear 
                          weapons. The political situation is delicate, both internally 
                          and in the global community; in the past, Iran has had 
                          dealings with purportedly terrorist groups. The internal 
                          government has reached a level of total instability.<br>
