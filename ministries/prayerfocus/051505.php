                          GCC will be sending out teams to Micronesia and Peru 
                          for five weeks, along with a team to Micronesia for 
                          2 weeks. The teams will be leaving on July 4th, 2005. 
                          The GCC members will be partnering with other missionaries 
                          from the AMI churches.<br>

                          The teams desire to be God&#8217;s instruments for the 
                          furthering of His kingdom by ministering through Vacation 
                          Bible School, addressing physical needs by aiding with 
                          medical services, and other evangelism outreaches. Teams 
                          will focus on prayer for the salvation and healing of 
                          the native people to encounter Christ. Developing Christ-centered 
                          relationships and facilitating environments of prayer 
                          is another main priority. In all, the teams desire to 
                          be used mightily by God for the advancement of His kingdom.<br>
