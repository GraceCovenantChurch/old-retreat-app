                          Easter Season - March 14, 2004</strong></p>
                        <p align="left">&#8220;I 
                          want to know Christ and the power of His resurrection 
                          and the fellowship of sharing in His sufferings, becoming 
                          like Him in His death, and so, somehow, to attain to 
                          the resurrection from the dead.&#8221; </p>
                        <p align="left">Both 
                          inside and outside of the Church, Easter seems to bring 
                          a renewed interest in Spiritual matters. Church attendance 
                          seems to rise and families gather to celebrate. Yet 
                          we as a Church know there is more to this time of year 
                          than bunnies, eggs, and family dinners. The Resurrection 
                          of our Lord Jesus from the dead which is celebrated 
                          on Easter Sunday is the cornerstone of Christianity.</p>
                        <p align="left">Because 
                          Jesus is alive, we know that one day we will live forever. 
                          We also know that Christ&#8217;s victory over sin and 
                          death, came only after His sacrifice and crucifixion. 
                          As a body we would like to make this years Easter Season 
                          a time where we can really reflect on the Lord&#8217;s 
                          Passion, thank him for His Sacrifice, celebrate in His 
                          Resurrection, and live in His Victory. Listed below 
                          are some events/activities we as a church will observe 
                          in the coming weeks: </p>

                          us this Friday evening for an extended time of prayer

                          Easter Season. The Prayer Vigil also marks the beginning 
                          of our 21 Day Daniel Fast (details below) and will be 
                          held at the Ardmore United Methodist Church. We will
