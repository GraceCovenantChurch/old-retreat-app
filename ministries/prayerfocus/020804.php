                        <p align="left">On 
                          Friday, February 6th, a subway train headed toward the 
                          Paveletskaya station in Moscow exploded in a suspected 
                          terrorist bombing, killing at least 39 people and injuring 
                          120 more. The Moscow underground metro is the busiest 
                          in the world, with a daily traffic of 9 million people. 
                          A bomb aimed at the heart of Moscow has deeply shaken 
                          the Russian people&#8217;s sense of security.</p>
                        <p align="left">The 
                          public, as well as the Russian government, has been 
                          quick to pin the blame on Chechen separatists who have 
                          been fighting their &#8220;endless war&#8221; for independence 
                          since 1991. In 1996, the Russian army suffered a humiliating 
                          defeat and Chechnya elected their own president, Aslan 
                          Maskhadov, a war-time commander and hero.</p>
                        <p align="left">However, 
                          this leader was unable to control his officers during 
                          peacetime and the new republic collapsed into anarchy. 
                          Russia also failed, for its part, to invest in reconstruction 
                          and a strong ring of organized crime developed. It was 
                          in this period that Chechnya gained its reputation for 
                          violence and terrorism, earning it the distinction of 
                          being one of the hostage-taking capitals of the world.</p>
                        <p align="left">In 
                          1999, the largely Muslim majority of Chechnya responded 
                          to a call to take up arms in a holy war against Russia. 
                          The rebellion was crushed within a matter of weeks. 
                          However, when a wave of explosions in Russia which killed 
                          hundreds of civilians hit just a few months later, all 
                          eyes immediately turned to Chechnya. On October 1st, 
                          1999, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin began his &#8220;anti-terror 
                          operation&#8221; and sent in the Russian troops in a 
                          brutal campaign that has still not been resolved to 
                          this day. </p>
                        <p align="left">Russia 
                          had been repeated criticized for its brutality in Chechnya 
                          up until September 11th. Since the Chechens are suspected 
                          to have ties to al-Qaeda, the Russian government jumped 
                          on the chance to incriminate the Chechens into a much 
                          larger ring of terrorism.</p>

                            <strong>The People of Chechnya </strong>&#8211; Except 
                            for leaders wfho desire self-autonomy, the people 
                            simply desire peace and stability after more than 
                            a decade of extreme disorder and violence. Since media 
                            is restricted in Russia, the world has been largely 
                            ignorant of their situation, leading the Chechens 
                            to feel forgotten and betrayed by a West that has 
                            struck up friendship with Russia while ignoring their 
                            situation. The desperation of the situation is reflected 
                            in the fact that many of the suicide bombers are female, 
                            many of whom have lost their loved-ones, livelihood, 
                            and will to live. <br>

                            leadership of Russian and Chechnya</strong> &#8211; 
                            One side views the conflict as war for liberation 
                            and the other sees an anti-terrorism campaign. Please 
                            pray for wisdom for the leaders and a desire for peace 
                            more than pride or ambition.</li>
