                          June 18th to August 3rd, our brothers and sisters (Sang 
                          Lee, Chris Kim, David Yim, Susan Jo, Tonna Wu, Melissa 
                          Yi, Laura Fung, Jessica Oh, and Pastor Paul Liu) will 
                          be traveling to the country of Peru on a summer mission 
                          trip. There they will encounter a variety of landscapes, 
                          cultures and people while participating in a number 
                          of different ministries such as Vacation Bible School 
                          for children, church crusades, and open air evangalism. 
                          As the team continues to train in preparation for the 
                          summer, we as a congregation would like to partner with 
                          them through prayer. </p>

                              within this team. Pray that the LORD would develop 
                              within each member a servant's heart, a growing 
                              and hungry Spirit, greater faith, more spiritual

                              the LORD would open doors for the Gospel as our 
                              team ministers in university classrooms, the inner 
                              city, outdoor crusades, as well as the local churches.<br>

                              have yet to hear the Gospel. Let us pray that God 
                              would give the team a spiritual boldness and love 
                              for the people of these regions.<br>

                              the state of Cusco, there are approximately 7,000 
                              villages that do not have a local Christian church. 
                              Pray that the LORD would send workers into this 
                              area. Pray also that God would break the intense 
                              spiritual strongholds that have gripped the people 
                              of that region for generations. <br>

                              the past few months to prepare for the spiritual 
                              battle ahead of them. Pray as they continue to train 
                              spiritually, mentally and physically for this summer, 
                              God would be their strength and focus.<br>
