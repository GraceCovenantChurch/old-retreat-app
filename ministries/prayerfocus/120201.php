                            In his first epistle to the people of Thessalonica, 
                            Paul exhorts the Thessalonians to be joyful always, 
                            pray continually, [and] give thanks in all circumstances. 
                            In light of this instruction we would like to continue 
                            to thank the Lord for the many ways He has blessed 
                            our church. There are so many ways in which the Lord 
                            has shown us unmerited favor; we know that there will 
                            many more such blessings in the future. Through them 
                            all, may we be a people marked by thankful hearts.

                                Since then God has multiplied us by over 600%. 
                                Take some time to thank the Lord for the ways 
                                He has made this church grow; furthermore, offer

                                many blessing in our family groups. Let’s take 
                                some time to thank the Lord for our family groups,
