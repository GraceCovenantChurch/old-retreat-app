                        <p align="left">We 
                          continue to pray in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina 
                          this week:</p>
                        <p><strong>Prayer 
                          Requests:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Praise 
                            God for the assistance that has poured into the city 
                            from various sources. Please pray that many others 
                            who are without money, food, or shelter would receive 
                            access to the necessary aid quickly and efficiently.<br>
                            <br>
                            </li>
                          <li>Praise 
                            God, also, for the less-than-expected death count 
                            so far in New Orleans. A recent sweep of the city 
                            revealed far fewer deaths than had been expected. 
                            25,000 body bags have been prepared but it appears 
                            that those numbers were overestimates. Pray that the 
                            rescue squads and cleanup crews would strive to maintain 
                            systematic and orderly progress in the months ahead.<br>
                            <br>
                            </li>
                          <li>Pray 
                            for the local churches and Christian organizations 
                            that have been contributing in efforts to provide 
                            aid. Please pray that they would emanate the gospel 
                            of Christ in the midst of tragedy with compassion 
                            and empathy. Pray that through the body of Christ, 
                            souls would find comfort and worship God even in times 
                            like this.<br>
                          </li>
