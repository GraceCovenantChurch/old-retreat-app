                          Borah Family In the coming weeks, we would like to pray 
                          for specific mission fields that we support as a church. 
                          This week, India and the Borah family will be our focus. 
                          Bernard and Jena Borah work with Gospel for Asia to 
                          reach the many people in India who have never heard 
                          the gospel and to help meet their most basic needs.

                          Raising up native missionaries is the primary means 
                          by which Gospel for Asia works to love and serve the 
                          unreached people of Asia. Bernard serves at Gospel for 
                          Asia as a volunteer manager. He recruits and trains 
                          volunteers all over the country to share the ministry 
                          of Gospel for Asia with their friends and churches. 
                          Jena has written numerous radio stories concerning Gospel 
                          for Asia&#8217;s work of supported native missionaries 
                          in Asia. <br>

                          The Borahs are currently in India until March 19th supporting 
                          and learning from the missionaries there. Listed below

                              nearly 600 million who belong to the low caste and

                              years. Pray for improved quality of life, education, 
                              and equality for these lowest sectors of a segregated
