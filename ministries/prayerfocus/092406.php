<p>
The Journey Church of Atlanta was founded in the summer of 2004, when seven church plant team members from GCC traveled to Atlanta with the vision of spiritual transformation among college students in the greater Atlanta area.  Led by Pastor Matthew Ro, JCA has steadily grown and received many blessings from God in the past two years.
<p>
Coming off a retreat this weekend, JCA hopes to continue to multiply, mature and mobilize passionate worshipers of Jesus Christ for the glory of God.
<p>
<b>Prayer Requests:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Young Adult Ministry Growth:</b> Pray for the young adult ministry to double in membership.</li>
<li><b>Consistent Meeting Locations and Student Group Recognition:</b> Pray that the church be able to secure consistent meeting locations and increase group recognition at Emory, Georgia Tech, and Georgia State.</li>
<li><b>Growth in Attendance:</b> Pray for a 50% in attendance for Quest (Friday night gathering) and Sunday service.</li>
<li><b>Pastor Young:</b> Pray that Pastor Young, who was the main speaker at the JCA retreat, be blessed by the experience and energized for the upcoming week.  Also pray for fruitfulness from his preaching the word of God.</li>
