                          November 2003, after a few months of prayer, Pastor 
                          Young and Pastor Matt traveled to Atlanta, GA for a 
                          vision trip. Our church prayed to see the same kind 
                          of Gospel-based, passion-filled ministry reaching the 
                          college students in Atlanta. In early July, the team 
                          will begin ministering at Emory University, Georgia

                          and other local college/university campuses.<br>

                          of the three universities. Church membership has been 
                          increasing and they plan to send a team to Peru this
