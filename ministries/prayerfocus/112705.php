<p>
Last May, an attempt to overthrow the Uzbekistan free government and force an Islamic state included acts of murder and violence, causing rampant chaos across the nation.  Recently, an Uzbek court found 15 men guilty of terrorist acts, aggravated murder and the seizure of hostages.  
<p>
Uzbekistan, after gaining its independence in 1991, has struggled to function as a democratic republic.  However, its influence is well-noted; often times, as Uzbekistan goes, so goes the rest of Central Asia.  Nevertheless, Uzbekistan remains a country in need of relief for their ecological disasters and religious oppression.
<p>
<b>Please pray for:</b>
<p>
<ul>
 <li><b>Wisdom and opportunities in government.</b>  Please pray that the nation’s leaders would uphold justice, work to remedy poverty and encourage economic growth.  Pray that they would quash the oppression of Christians and free many of the Christians that are imprisoned because of their organization of "unregistered" groups.</li>
 <li><b>The victory of the gospel.</b>  Please pray that Christians would remain bold and impacting among native Uzbeks.  Pray for those unreached; only a small fraction of the primarily Muslim population have ever had the opportunity to believe at all.  Pray especially for the Karakalpaks, a group that has been suffering from many physical ailments and has been very responsive to Christ.</li>
