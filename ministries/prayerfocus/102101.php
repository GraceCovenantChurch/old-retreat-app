                          <P align="left"> The 
                            country of Afghanistan has received much news coverage 
                            since the September 11th attacks and recent US air 
                            strikes. This week, we would like to pray for the 
                            people of Afghanistan, who have experienced continual 
                            hardship over the past few decades through military 
                            conflict and civil war.  
                          <P align="left">The 
                            country has been ravaged by a severe famine brought 
                            about by a four-year drought and lives under the harsh 
                            governmental rule of the Taliban, which has enforced 
                            stringent rules through brutal and abusive means. 
                            Already the largest single refugee group for the 19th 
                            year in a row*, hundreds of thousands of Afghans are 
                            currently attempting to flee the country in the midst 
                            of air strikes and a fast-approaching winter. 
                          <P align="left">Below 
                            are several prayer topics and requests for Afghanistan: 
                          <div align="left"> 
                            <ul>
                              <li> Women 
                                in the cities have been severely repressed by 
                                the Taliban regime. They have been banished from 
                                public life, forbidden employment, restricted 
                                to the home, denied education and health services 
                                and suffer at the hands of men, with no recourse 
                                to any justice. One in four women are widows, 
                                and many are destitute. Depression and suicide 
                                are commonplace. Pray for basic human rights to 
                                be restored to women.<br>
                                <br>
                                </li>
                              <li> There 
                                are approximately 70-80 unreached people groups 
                                in this nation. Pray that abuses by the Taliban 
                                regime will cause many to seek God. Also pray 
                                that the unprecedented openness to the gospel 
                                created by these sufferings may ultimately lead 
                                to a great harvest.<br>
                                <br>
                                </li>
                              <li> Though 
                                there is no visible church in Afghanistan, the 
                                number of Afghan believers is increasing in urban 
                                and some remote rural areas. Because of fear and 
                                suspicion, many believers find it difficult to 
                                meet in groups. The Taliban religious police are 
                                active in seeking out ‘converts’ who are considered 
                                apostates. Pray for their protection, consistency 
                                of faith and clarity of witness whenever opportunity 
                                arises.<br>
                                <br>
                                </li>
                              <li> Pray 
                                for foreign and local missionary workers who were 
                                recently arrested and whose whereabouts are unaccounted 
                                for. Current radical interpretation of the Islamic 
                                law by the Taliban carries a death sentence for 
                                such activity.<br>
                                <br>
                                </li>
                              <li> Pray 
                                for a just, fair and honorable post-Taliban government 
                                to be raised up for this tragic land.<br>
                                <br>
                                </li>
                              <li> Pray 
                                for the US and its leaders that God would grant 
                                much wisdom and discernment in dealing with the 
                                war on terrorism and bringing terrorists to justice.
