                      <p align="left"><strong>Iraq War - February 04, 2007</strong></p>
<p>
The United States led an invasion of Iraq in March 2003 under the codename “Operation Iraqi Freedom,” starting a controversial war that continues to be fought today.  The reasons for the invasion and the consequences of it are hotly debated topics.
<p>
Almost four years after the conflict began, the Iraq War remains the preeminent issue on the national and international scene.
<p>
<b>Prayer Requests:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Safety and Families:</b> Pray for the support and safety of the troops who are fighting in Iraq and for their families back home.</li>
<li><b>Troop Surge:</b> President George W. Bush recently proposed an increase of more than 20,000 troops for Iraq.  The idea was quickly rejected by Congress.  Pray that the issue does not further divide an already partisan government, and that the decision is made with wisdom and discernment.</li>
<li><b>Mission:</b> Most importantly, pray that God’s will be done.  Pray that political strife does not dictate decision-making, and that the war be resolved in a manner that ensures safety both for the United States and the Middle East.</li>
</ul>
