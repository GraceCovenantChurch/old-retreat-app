<p>
The Lord has blessed Grace Covenant Church with the purchase of a twin house in Upper Darby (near 69th street). Currently, it is being used for small group gatherings, the church office, and special events. Please pray that this house will be a house of prayer and a meeting place to cultivate deeper community within our church. We also desire that this house be used to the glory of God to witness to neighbors and the surrounding community. Although the house is functional right now, there is much work that needs to be done. Future renovation plans include adding a bathroom on the first floor, finishing the basement, renovating the kitchen, and securing the garage.  
<p>
<b>Please Pray for:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>The wisdom to use the house to its fullest potential for the glory of God.</b> From the basement to the garage, pray that every space gets used to advance the kingdom of God through our church.</li>
<li><b>The financial means to make the necessary renovations.</b> Please pray that God would bring fair and sound contractors in partnership with us throughout the renovation process.</li>
<li><b>The entire church taking ownership of the house to utilize the space and maintain the house in working order.</b></li>
</ul>
