<p>
In 2002, AMI was founded as a network of churches.  Churches in the network include GCC, HMCC (Michigan), The Remnant Presbyterian Church (NY), Remnant Westside (NY), Church of Southland (California), and JCA (Atlanta).  AMI is a community of churches seeking to model the spirituality, vision, and partnership exemplified in the book of Acts.  AMI is committed to developing disciples of Christ within our churches, as well as spreading the gospel message to unreached people through church planting and missions work.

<p>
<b>Please pray for:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Edification of the network at events such as the AMI Revolution Conference.</b>  Please continue to pray for the conference, that it would bear fruit and that convictions would stir action.  More generally, pray for the relationships established between the churches in the AMI network through future events and joint projects.</li>
<li><b>Global missions work.</b>  Please pray for vision and strength for the AMI missions projects all around the world.  Involvement reaches nations in Latin America and Central Asia.  Pray that AMI would prove to be strategically advantageous in accomplishing His Kingdom work internationally.</li>
<li><b>Church planting.</b>  JCA is the first of what is hoped to be many church plants.  Pray that God would continue to use AMI to reach many places in this country and around the world through churches, and that He would raise up passionate workers to do faithful ministry in church planting.</li>
