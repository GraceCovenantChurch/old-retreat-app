                        <p align="left">While 
                          Saudi Arabia has modernized rapidly due to its abundant 
                          oil resources, it is still a nation that is highly traditional 
                          in its governmental and political style. The ruling 
                          family, the Al Saud, has maintained reign since 1932. 
                          Combined with intense Sunni Muslim beliefs, the royal 
                          family does not tolerate dissidents or even criticism 
                          of any kind. This has resulted in restricted state-run 
                          media and fear instilled in the lives of citizens. However, 
                          with increasing domestic and international terrorism, 
                          Saudi Arabia faces political and military issues that 
                          demand more boldness and open media reports. </p>
                        <p align="left"><strong>Prayer 
                          requests:</strong> </p>
                        <ul>
                          <li><strong>The 
                            War on Terror: </strong>Saudi 
                            Arabia has been reported to be a sponsor of international 
                            terrorism by the West despite its &#8220;friendly&#8221; 
                            status as one of the Middle East&#8217;s richest oil 
                            producers. Although its role in the War on Terror 
                            is dubious, Saudi Arabia is slowly clamping down on 
                            what it calls &#8220;deviant groups,&#8221; that sponsor 
                            or actively participate in terrorism. <br>
                            <br>
                            Yesterday, a few wanted militants were found by security 
                            guard and a shoot-out ensued. Several of the men died. 
                            The incident reveals the dangerous situation in Saudi 
                            Arabia, especially for those protecting the citizens. 
                            Pray that Saudi Arabia would continue to actively 
                            guard against terrorists and denounce their actions.<br>
                            <br>
                            </li>
                          <li><strong>Missionaries 
                            in Muslim countries:</strong> Many of the Muslim countries 
                            are similar to Saudi Arabia in their governing style. 
                            This discourages Christian missionary work in these 
                            countries. In addition, Saudi Arabia is in the heart 
                            of the 10/40 window, the area of the world that has 
                            yet to hear the Gospel. Pray that God would raise 
                            leaders and senders to have a burden to go into these 
                            countries. Also, please pray that the missionaries 
                            in these countries would be fearless in preaching 
                            the Gospel and discipling new believers.</li>
