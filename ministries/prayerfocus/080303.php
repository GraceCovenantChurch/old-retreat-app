                        <p align="left">Created 
                          in 1948 in the aftermath of World War II, North Korea 
                          is one of a few countries still under Communist rule. 
                          In the years since, this country has also pursued a 
                          strict policy of isolation and its history has been 
                          dominated by its &#8216;Great Leader&#8217;, Kim Il-Sung. 
                          The government&#8217;s extremely strict control has 
                          led to economic stagnation and amounted to little more 
                          than a dictatorship. Aid agencies estimate that up to 
                          2 million people have died since the mid 1990&#8217;s 
                          due to food shortages. Most recently, North Korea has 
                          come into the spotlight when in October 2002, the US 
                          accused this country of developing a secret nuclear 
                          weapons program.</p>
                        <p align="left">Though 
                          many experts believe that this program has been underway 
                          since the mid-1990&#8217;s, the matter did not receive 
                          international attention until October of 2002 with the 
                          US accusation. North Korea responded by throwing out 
                          UN inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency 
                          and backing out of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
                          </p>
                        <p align="left">Relations 
                          with North Korea have been increasingly tense since 
                          President Bush named the country as part of his &#8216;Axis 
                          of Evil&#8217;. Recently, however, North Korea has agreed 
                          to enter into talks about its nuclear program and has 
                          also agreed to talk to US allies, namely South Korea 
                          and Japan, about this issue. The announcement should 
                          pave the way for a six-nation talk sometime in the near 
                          future. The participating countries will be the US, 
                          North Korea, South Korea, Japan, Russia, and China.</p>

                              government is extremely unstable and is faced with 
                              mounting economic and social problems which may 
                              drive it to use its nuclear program as a weapon 
                              or as illegal income. Pray that in spite of the 
                              urgency, leaders on all sides will strive to find 
                              diplomatic solutions where there may not be any 
                              readily available and that they would use wisdom 
                              in handling a potentially explosive situation<br>

                              of the main reasons for controlling North Korea&#8217;s 
                              nuclear weapons is to secure a safe way of dismantling 
                              such an oppressive regime. Many of the people live 
                              under extreme poverty or suffer brutally in prisons 
                              or labor camps, often for trivial &#8220;crimes&#8221;. 
                              The people are not allowed to speak or worship freely 
                              and flooded with propaganda from every form of media. 
                              Please pray for God&#8217;s comfort to come to the 
                              persecuted church and to the many suffering. </li>
