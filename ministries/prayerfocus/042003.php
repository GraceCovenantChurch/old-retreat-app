                          <br>
                          “For God so loved the world that He gave His one and 
                          only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish 
                          but have eternal life” John 3:16. A familiar Bible verse 
                          for many, Christians often neglect the first half of 
                          the verse – God's heart for the world. In the great 
                          commission, Jesus commanded his disciples to go and 
                          make disciples of all nations. <br>
                          <br>
                          Although not all Christians are called physically to 
                          overseas missions, God's heart for the world and the 
                          Christian’s responsibility to participate in God's mission 
                          to all people are undeniable. In learning to understand 
                          God’s heart for the world, the Christian must proceed 
                          in prayer. To pray more effectively for the world and 
                          the mobilization of God’s kingdom, however, Christians 
                          must become more knowledgeable about the world around 
                          them. <br>
                          <br>
                          One practical step Christians can take is keeping abreast 
                          of current events occurring around the world. Another 
                          suggestion is to visit the mission table in the fellowship 
                          hall. The mission table provides information about the 
                          various missionaries GCC supports and is an excellent 
                          means in learning more about the world through a Gospel 
                          perspective. </P>
