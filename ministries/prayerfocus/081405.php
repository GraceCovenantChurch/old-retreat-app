                          United Nations - August 14, 2005</strong></p>
                        <p align="left">In 
                          1945, representatives from 50 countries came together 
                          in San Francisco and drew up the United Nations Charter. 
                          The Charter emphasizes peace, human rights, and international 
                          relations so as to address the issues at the heart of 
                          World War II. Today, the UN consists of 191 Member States, 
                          supervised by the 15-member Security Council (five of 
                          whom are permanent). Sub-organizations of the UN include 
                          UNICEF, the International Court of Justice, and the 
                          UN Development Programme.<br>
                          <br>
                          <img src="un/un.png" width="128" height="116" align="right">Recently, 
                          the United Nations has been under fire because of an 
                          ongoing investigation in the oil-for-food program that 
                          prevented starvation in the midst of economic sanctions. 
                          The program was discovered to be corrupt and overrun 
                          by major corporate bribes, and recently, a key UN procurement 
                          officer pleaded guilty to charges of fraud. Secretary-General 
                          Kofi Annan and his son have endured much scrutiny.<br>
                          <br>
                          Compounded with other events, the United Nations has 
                          lost of much of its credibility. On the U.S. side, the 
                          appointment of John Bolton as US Ambassador was a controversial 
                          measure to begin reforming the organization.<br>
                          <br>
                          The 
                          United Nations has been the single most pivotal multinational 
                          organization in the world. Humanitarian aid, peacekeeping 
                          interventions, and the abolition of global poverty are 
                          some of its lofty goals. A lack of solidarity hampers 
                          the UN from moving forward on many actions, some of 
                          which would reach those in desperate need.</p>
