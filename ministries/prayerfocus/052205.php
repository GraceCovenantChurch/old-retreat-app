                        <p align="left">In 
                          1991 Uzbekistan emerged as a sovereign country after 
                          more than a century of Russian rule - first as part 
                          of the Russian empire and then as a component of the 
                          Soviet Union. It is the most populous Central Asian 
                          country and has the largest armed forces.<br>
                          <br>
                          This month, protests against the government&#8217;s 
                          imprisonment of 23 men charged with Islamic extremism 
                          resulted in open fire and the death of about 170 civilians. 
                          Last week, rebel Bakhtior Rakhimov and other locals 
                          threw out their leaders in hopes of establishing an 
                          Islamic state in Uzbekistan. The government has taken 
                          control of the situation but continues to hold a tight 
                          rein on its Uzbek citizens.<br>
