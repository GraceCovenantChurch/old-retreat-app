<p>
HMCC began with a group of eight people that wanted to see an Acts 2 church on the campus of the University of Michigan. In Acts 2:42-47, the early church consisted of people meeting together for fellowship, teaching, prayer, and worship. They were becoming disciples of Christ, and God added to their number daily as people were being saved. God chose to spread the good news of Jesus Christ through this early church, and HMCC also hopes to be used by God to transform the world in the same way. With this guidance from God's Word, their mission and vision are established.
<p>
<b>Please pray for:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>The various ministries of the church.</b>  Please pray that the new Renew ministry, founded in 2005, would reach the men and women in need of restoration in their various walks of life.  Pray also for their high school ministry (reaching the local high school students in Ann Arbor), children’s ministry, small groups, sports ministry, and missions teams would bear great fruit in that body of Christ.</li>
<li><b>The leadership of Pastor Seth Kim and the staff at HMCC.</b>  Pray that Pastor Seth would continue to be anointed in his vision for the church and that the staff would have open hearts listening to the Spirit of God.</li>
<li><b>The greater glory of God through HMCC as a fellow church in AMI.</b>  The AMI network offers us an exciting opportunity to pray for our brothers and sisters all around the world with a unified spirit for our joint vision.  Pray that HMCC would be used to fulfill God’s glorious plan within the commitments it sustains within the vision of AMI.</li>
