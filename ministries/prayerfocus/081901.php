                          this Thursday, August 23 until Saturday, August 25, 
                          the Servants Team of our church will be preparing for 
                          the upcoming 2001 - 2002 ministry year by participating 
                          in the 2001 Servant's Retreat. The Servants Team is 
                          made up of the brothers and sisters of our church who 
                          act as the servants (leaders), co-servants, and helpers 
                          within our family groups. This retreat provides a wonderful 
                          opportunity for our Servant's Team to prepare for the 
                          upcoming ministry year through listening to various 
                          seminars/sermons, times of prayer, worship, etc. </p>
                        <p align="left">It 
                          is the prayer of this church that the LORD would use 
                          the upcoming Servant's Retreat to bless and strengthen 
                          the servants of our church so that they can, in turn, 
                          be used to bless and strengthen this congregation.<br>
                          <br>
                          Listed below are some ways you can pray for the 2001 
                          Servant's Retreat and your Servant, Co-Servant(s), and 
                          Helper(s).</p>

                              of the Holy Spirit: </b>Each individual's ministry 
                              is an overflow of God's ministry on the individual. 
                              Our servants cannot give unless they have recieved 
                              from the LORD, they cannot teach unles they have 
                              learned, and they cannot loved unless Christ's hear 
                              compels them to do so. Pray that the Holy Spirit 
                              would anoint our servants, so they would become 
                              living, breathing instruments of God's love. <br>

                              speaker will be Rev. Victor Kim, Senior Pastor at 
                              Remmant Presbyterian Church in Manhattan. Pray that 
                              the LORD would use Rev. Victor to preach the Word; 
                              pray that the Word fo God would change lives.<br>

                              of Joy, Privilege, Thanksgiving, and Servitude:</b> 
                              We are thankful for the innumerable ways that the 
                              LORD has blessed this church during the last five 
                              years. There is no denying that the LORD is the 
                              One who has been building this church. As the servants 
                              get ready for the year, pray that they would always 
                              be overcome by a sense of thanksgiving that the 
                              LORD has allowed them to be a part of what He is 
                              doing here at GCC. It is a privilege to serve, especially 
                              when in truth the LORD does not need people to build 
                              His Kingdom.<br>
                              <br>

                              of Love and Humility:</b> Pray that each servant 
                              would have a greater understanding of God's love 
                              for His people. Pray for humility, as every servant 
                              needs to grow more and more in the grace and knowledge 
                              of our LORD, and also pray that each servant would 
                              have an unquenchable desire to see the Kingdom of 
                              God built in our generation.</li>
