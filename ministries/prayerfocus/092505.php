                        <p>In the summer of 2004, Pastor Matt Ro and a group from GCC went to Atlanta to plant a church with a vision of reaching the campuses in the city (Georgia State, Emory, and Georgia Tech).  The Journey Church of Atlanta (JCA) is now just over a year old and seeks many of the same goals as GCC.  It is a mission-focused, multi-ethnic campus church in the city.
			<p>
Let us continue to uphold and pray for our brothers and sisters at JCA:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li><b>Pastor Young is speaking at their congregational retreat this weekend.</b>  Please pray that God would use him in a timely, specific way to touch and transform the lives in the body of JCA.
                            </li>
                          <p><li><b>Please pray for the staff of JCA.</b>  Please pray for strength and wisdom for Pastor Matt Ro, Pastor Dave Kwon, Pastor Fred Kim, Danny Kim, Jen Hogan, and others that are on staff.  Pray that God would use the training they received at GCC to fulfill His vision and build their ministry.
                            </li>
			  <p><li><b>Pray for continual growth in every area of JCA.</b>  Their numbers have been steadily increasing, requiring many new strategies and resources.  Pray that spiritually, they would abide in Christ and bear much fruit (John 15:5) and numerically, God would add to their number daily (Acts 2:47).</li>
