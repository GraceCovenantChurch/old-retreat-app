<p>
Operation World is a publication put out by Worldwide Evangelization for Christ (WEC) International.  It is one of their most important supplementary works to their overall purpose of planting churches among the least reached people in the world.  It contains a profile on every country in the world, information about its unreached people groups, and relevant prayer requests.  This serves as a tool for Christians everywhere to pray for the needs of the missions work happening across the entire world.
<p>
Our sister, Jen Yuh, will be departing for London at the beginning of June, to work with WEC on the next edition of Operation World.
<p>
<b>Please pray for:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>A strong entry.</b>  Upon arrival, she will be taking part in a retreat in Scotland with her team.  Pray that her arrival in the UK would be smooth.</li>
<li><b>Effectiveness in ministry.</b>  The team is completely new except for one remaining member from the last edition.  The next edition is due in 2008, and there is a host of things that could hinder the process.  Pray that the updates and advances they envision would be realized and that everything from foreign contacts to computer stability would run smoothly.  Pray also that the team itself would find Spirit-led unity to accomplish the task.</li>
<li><b>Spiritual protection.</b>  Although it is a different type of ministry than typical missions work, their work is close and personal to the front lines of the missions field.  Pray that God would show favor on this work for His ultimate glory as He establishes His kingdom.</li>
