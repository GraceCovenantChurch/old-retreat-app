                        <p align="left">On 
                          Monday, February 7, fighting in the southern most islands 
                          (Jolo) of the Philippines broke out between militant 
                          rebel forces and the government of the Philippines. 
                          There are several Islamic militant rebel forces in the 
                          Philippines, three of which are named Abu Sayyaf, Moro 
                          Islamic Liberation Front, and the Moro National Liberation 
                          Front. Among 
                          these, Abu Sayyaf is the smallest and has been linked 
                          to Al Qaeda. </p>
                        <p align="left">These 
                          groups are fighting for an Islamic nation of their own. 
                          So far, 60 people have died due to the violence and 
                          there is no signal of truce or ceasefire.<br>

                            nation in the Philippines. Pray that they would experience 
                            God&#8217;s love in a real way and end their destruction.

                            conflict. In 1996, the rebel forces signed a peace 
                            deal with the government of Manila but there has been 
                            little progress.</li>
