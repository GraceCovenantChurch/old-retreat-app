                        <p align="left">It 
                          is Grace Covenant Church's desire to be a part of God's 
                          plan as He builds His kingdom. A very large aspect of 
                          this is foreign and domestic missions. Therefore, as 
                          a body, we have been blessed to be able to support some 
                          of our brothers and sisters who partner with us in building 
                          God's kingdom. Lister below are the people that our 
                          church supports financially. </p>
                        <p align="left">It 
                          is the conviction of this church that 35% of our offerings 
                          goes to foreign and domestic missions. Please pray for 
                          God's provision and protection as these missionaries 
                          serve and proclaim the Gospel from Philadelphia to the 
                          ends of the Earth.</p>
