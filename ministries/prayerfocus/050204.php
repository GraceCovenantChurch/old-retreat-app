                          In November 2003, after a few months of prayer, Pastor 
                          Young and Pastor Matt traveled to Atlanta, GA for a 
                          vision trip. Our church would like to see the same kind 
                          of Gospel-based, passion-filled ministry reaching the 
                          college students in Atlanta. In early July, the team 
                          will begin ministering at Emory University, Georgia 
                          Institute of Technology (GTech), Georgia State University, 
                          and other local college/university campuses.<br>

                          Since gaining independence from Spain in 1824, Peru 
                          has had a long history of dictatorship and military 
                          rule. Peru's development has also been hindered by widespread 
                          corruption and the failure of successive governments 
                          to address social and economic inequality. Our 6th Peru 
                          Team will be serving the Lord through community service, 
                          open-air evangelism, church presentations, and Vacation 
                          Bible School. </p>

                          The team will spend about a week in Phnom Penh (capital 
                          of Cambodia) orienting ourselves to the people as well 
                          as the culture there. The team will then head to Poem 
                          Treung to do medical missions as well as teaching VBS 
                          at the Bright Future School. They will also have the 
                          opportunity to serve the community of Kean Svay by doing
