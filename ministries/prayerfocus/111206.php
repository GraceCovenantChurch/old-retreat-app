<p>
Dr. Steve Lee, his wife Betty, and their five children Joy, Noelle, Luke, Bethany, and Judah have been serving the Lord in Kenya through Africa Inland Mission International since August 2004.  Their primary focus in Kenya includes long-term medical and church planting work in Kapsowar.
<p>
The family’s journey began 20 years ago, when Dr. Steve served in Kenya while Betty served in Haiti.  Pray for continued faithfulness and blessings from the Lord, and for the family’s safety and growth.
<p>
<b>Prayer Requests:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Relationships:</b> Pray for relationships with local congregations in setting the stage for further ministries, such as pastors’ training seminars.</li>
<li><b>Perseverance:</b> Pray that the family continues to follow the footsteps of Christ and love the people of Kenya as Christ loves and identifies with them.</li>
<li><b>God’s Favor:</b> Pray that God would move the hearts of the political leaders of Kenya so they would assist in the expansion of God’s kingdom.</li>
<li><b>Increased Financial Support:</b> Pray for increased funding for the Kapsowar Hospital so that it can expand its medical ministries, which include mobile clinics and HIV/AIDS programs are a focus.</li>
<li><b>God’s Wisdom:</b> Not unlike Pastor Paul Liu and Ailsa’s daughter Caitlyn, Dr. Steve and Betty’s children are what some refer to as Third Culture Kids - in this case, the children’s identities fall somewhere in between Korean, American, and Kenyan.  Pray for God’s wisdom in dealing with the identity struggles of missionary children.</li>
