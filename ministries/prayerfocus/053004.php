                        <p align="left">Sudan 
                          is a nation torn by 21 years of civil war. In 1983, 
                          its government imposed Islamic Sharia law across Sudan. 
                          Black African Christians and traditional animists have 
                          been rebelling since. The hostilities have caused the 
                          conflict to become the longest running civil war on 
                          the continent; it has left about two million dead. <br>
                          <br>
                          The western region of Darfur is of particular concern 
                          because those victimized and displaced by the warfare 
                          have gathered there without homes and food. The situation 
                          has created one of the worst humanitarian crises on 
                          the planet today. </p>
                        <p><strong>Prayer 
                          requests for Sudan:</strong> </p>
                        <ul>
                          <li><strong>The 
                            peace process:</strong> This week, the Sudanese government 
                            and the rebels have made considerable progress by 
                            signing a framework to work towards the common goal 
                            of ending the hostilities. This marks a milestone 
                            in Sudanese history but the nation has a long way 
                            to go until its citizens will live in peace.<br>
                            <br>
                            There are many issues that need to be considered, 
                            the main one being the autonomy of southern Sudan. 
                            Southern Sudan is rich in oil resources, which must 
                            be divided in a fair way. Pray that the Sudanese government 
                            and those in power will continue to make peace using 
                            diplomacy.<br>

                          <li><strong>The 
                            crisis in Darfur:</strong> The United Nations has 
                            declared Darfur to be a humantarian tragedy. It is 
                            said that the Sudanese government and its militia 
                            are scorching villages in order to cleanse them of 
                            dissident rebel groups, leaving behind Sudanese who 
                            have become refugees in their own homelands. Pray 
                            that there will be people willing to go there and 
                            make a difference by bringing supplies, resources, 
                            and God&#8217;s love. <br>

                          <li><strong>The 
                            Sudanese Christians and missionaries:</strong> Black 
                            African Christians in Sudan are a minority yet they 
                            are fighting for autonomy. Some of them have been 
                            uprooted out of their homes and lack even the basic 
                            needs for survival. There is not enough medicine for 
                            the sick and worst of all, they have little hope that 
                            they will be able to return to their homes. Pray that 
                            the Christians in the area would gain strength and 
                            joy from the Lord.</li>
