<p>
The countries in the area known as the African Horn (Djibouti, Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya) are currently facing a severe drought that is expected to cause starvation for most of the region's populations. Aggregately, about 11 million people will suffer from food prices that are too high and from long term forecasts of low rain levels. Because they depend on livestock, a draught can cause considerable damage to the entire region. Children are especially vulnerable because they are more likely to contract diseases such as malaria and diarrhea due to lack of food and water.
<p>
Please Pray For:
<ul>
  <li>Please pray that international aid will be channeled correctly so that the most people can receive food and aid as possible.</li>
  <li>Please pray for the African governments to administrate wisely.</li>
  <li>Please pray for Christian workers in the area like Dr. Steve and others who are involved with the efforts there.</li>
  <li>Pray that the Africans would not receive just physical food, but also spiritual food.</li>
</ul>
