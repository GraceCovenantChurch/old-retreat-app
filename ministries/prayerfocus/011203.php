                          Congregational Retreat - January 12, 2003</strong></p>
                        <p align="left">As 
                          a church, one of the most important events of the year 
                          is the annual congregational retreat. The congregational 
                          retreat provides an excellent opportunity for church 
                          members to get away from the business of daily life 
                          and spend time in worship and renewal by God while fellowshipping 
                          with other church members. This coming retreat will 
                          take place from January 24th - 26th at NJ Christian 
                          Academy in Cream Ridge, NJ. </p>

                              Staff: </strong>Please pray for Pastor Young and 
                              our pastoral staff as they will be delivering the 
                              sermons and seminars. Pray that the LORD would press 
                              upon their hearts the Word of God. Pray for spiritual 
                              protection as they prepare.<br>

                              Groups:</strong> Much of the emphasis of this year's 
                              retreat will be in small group times. Please pray 
                              that the LORD would work within each group to foster 
                              a time of learning, sharing, accountability and 
                              prayer.<br>

                              </strong> Please pray for the hearts of the praise 
                              band members that their hearts would overflow with 
                              worship as they lead the times of praise. Pray also 
                              for the hearts of our congregation that our praise 
                              would be pleasing to God.<br>

                              </strong>Please pray that God's spirit would enable 
                              and teach our congregation how to pray. Pray also 
                              for Pastor Young as he leads us through the prayer 
                              times.<br>

                              comes will be ready to experience the blessings 
                              that God has in store for them. Pray that God would 
                              meet our spiritual needs and prepare us for the 
                              upcoming semester. Pray also for the times of fellowship.<br>
