                          is the fourth year Grace Covenant Church will send a 
                          summer mission team to Peru. The team will serve in 
                          a variety of different ministries from the city of Lima 
                          and the tribal villages in the Amazon jungle to the 
                          Inca-influenced tribed in the Andes. Please pray for 
                          the mission trip as GCC combines with Harvest Mission 
                          Community Church in Michigan to go to Peru from June 
                          17th to August 2nd.</p>

                          [coastland]: Of Peru's 25 million people, roughly 1/3 
                          live in this capital city. While it resembles other 
                          bustling cities, its amazing openness to the Gospel 
                          and the spiritual hunger of its people mark it as a 
                          place where the Lord's work is blossoming.</p>

                          Many go to great lengths to find churches, bibles, and

                          city of the Andes, along with nearby areas like Urabamba, 
                          still believes in a mix of witchcraft, idolatry and
