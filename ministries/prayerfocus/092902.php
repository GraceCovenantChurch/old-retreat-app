                            - September 29, 2002</b></p>
                          <p align="left">Pakistan 
                            was formed in 1947 when British India separated into 
                            the Muslim state of Pakistan (with two sections West 
                            and East) and largely Hindu India. Since then, the 
                            separation has never been fully resolves as the two 
                            countries have constantly been locked in conflict 
                            with each other. Pakistan came into the spotlight 
                            following the events of September 11, when President 
                            Gen. Pervez Musharraf, who took over the country through 
                            a military takeover in 1999, decided to assist the 
                            US in the war on terrorism in Afganistan.</p>
                          <p align="left">Pakistan, 
                            with a 97% Muslim population, is home to many extremist 
                            Islamic fundamentalist groups. Since President Pervez 
                            Musharraf began supporting the US anti-terror campaign 
                            last year, a spate of violet raids on Christian sites 
                            have killed 30 people and wounded about 100. This 
                            past week, seven workers at a Christian charity office 
                            in Pakistan were killed in the latest incident of 
                            anti-Christian violence.</p>
