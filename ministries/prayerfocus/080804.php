                        <p>Drexel 
                          University was founded in 1891 as the Drexel Institute 
                          of Art, Science and Industry by Philadelphia financier 
                          and philanthropist Anthony J. Drexel to provide educational 
                          opportunities in the &quot;practical arts and sciences&quot; 
                          for women and men of all backgrounds. The Drexel Institute 
                          of Technology gained university status in 1970, becoming 
                          Drexel University.</p>
                        <p>One 
                          of the distinct qualities of the Drexel experience is 
                          the co-op. Classroom learning, research, projects, papers 
                          and exams are critical to your academic pursuits, but 
                          Drexel offers an opportunity to gain work experience 
                          in your chosen field. You can gain up to 18 months of 
                          resume enhancing experience by graduation. There are 
                          more than 3,000 undergraduate students currently employed 
                          by 1,500 Drexel Co-op employers located in 42 states 
                          and 20 international locations</p>
                        <p>However, 
                          it is only recently that Grace Covenant Church has become 
                          extensively involved in Drexel Campus. In the past two 
                          years, the Drexel ministry has expanded beyond the bounds 
                          and brought more people closer to Christ,</p>
                        <p><strong>Prayer 
                          Requests</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                          <li><strong>The 
                            discipleship of Christians: </strong>The 
                            Drexel ministry has seen many new Christians grow 
                            and learn about what it means to follow Jesus. Pray 
                            that they will continue to be discipled through the 
                            Word, in prayer, and in sharing the Gospel.<br>

                            outreach:</strong> 
                            That students would receive not only practical preparation 
                            for their future occupation but an understanding of 
                            their eternal standing before God. Drexel begins classes 
                            at the end of September so please pray for a blessed 
                            season of outreach and embracing new students. </li>
