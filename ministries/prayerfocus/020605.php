                          nearly a decade, Maoist rebel forces have been waging 
                          a civil war, fighting for a Nepalese Communist regime. 
                          This past week, King Gyanendra claimed that the parliamentary 
                          government was not doing enough to protect the Nepalese 
                          from the Maoist forces, who have killed about 10,000 
                          of Nepal&#8217;s citizens.</p>
                        <p align="left">The 
                          King sacked power from the government and is now ruling 
                          by direct military authority. Political leaders such 
                          as the Prime Minister and Cabinet members have been 
                          put under house arrest. The media has been censored 
                          and student protesters have been silenced.</p>

                          <li><strong>The

                            agricultural and 40% of its citizens live in poverty. 
                            Tourism was a main source of revenue until now, many 
                            countries have issued warnings about traveling to 
                            Nepal.<br>

                            Security in the South Asian region is already unstable 
                            due to the Kashmiri crisis and other hostilities between 
                            India, Pakistan, and other nations. Pray that this 
                            crisis would not exacerbate the situation and that 
                            a peaceful resolve would be achieved.</li>
