<p>
This weekend, students gathered from all over the nation to Ann Arbor, Michigan, for the AMI Revolution 2006 Conference.  This year, the theme is “Compelled”, with a vision to spark hearts to live compelled by Christ’s love to surrender our own lives to the work of His kingdom (1 Cor. 5:14-15).
<p>
The summer missions projects have also gathered in Michigan to prepare for their days ahead.  The intensive training at HMCC gives the teams their first meeting with the different members from the AMI church community.
<p>
<b>Please pray for:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Continued blessing from the conference.</b>  Please pray that hearts would stay convicted with real application into daily living.  Pray that the intimacy with God they experienced would leave a lasting impression of glory in their hearts.</li>
<li><b>Physical and spiritual protection.</b>  The long journey back can be dangerous; please pray for physical and bodily safety.  Pray also for spiritual protection, as these times after blessing are the most vulnerable ones.  Pray that diligence and discipline would prevail in cementing the Spirit’s stirring in their hearts.</li>
<li><b>The missions teams’ training and departure.</b>  Pray that the Peru and India teams would integrate with great ease, as they meet together for the first time.  Pray that the week of intensive training would bond their hearts together and prepare them for the work that lies ahead.</li>
</ul>
