                            Situated at the crossroads of Asia and Europe, this 
                            land was the object of a rivalry between Turkey, Russia, 
                            and Persia until it was annexed by Russia in the 19th 
                            century. After the collapse of the USSR in 1991, Georgians 
                            voted overwhelmingly for the restoration of independence 
                            and elected nationalist leader Zviad Gamsakhurdia 
                            as president. However, Gamsakhurdia was soon overthrown 
                            by opposition militias which in 1992 installed former 
                            Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze as the 
                            country's new leader. </p>
                          <p align="left">During 
                            the 11 years of Mr. Shevardnadze's leadership, the 
                            Georgian people felt increasingly at the mercy of 
                            poverty, corruption and crime. The country&#8217;s 
                            economy also took a nosedive after it lost Russia&#8217;s 
                            cheap energy sources and suffered the effects civil 
                            war with the regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, 
                            both of which are fighting for their independence.</p>
                          <p align="left"><strong>Enough 
                            is Enough</strong><br>
                            To many Georgians Mr. Shevardnadze - once renowned 
                            for his role as Soviet foreign minister in ending 
                            the Cold War - is a failed leader who has been unable 
                            to deliver on issues such as rampant poverty and corruption, 
                            energy crises and resolution of conflicts such as 
                            that of the breakaway region of Abkhazia. On November 
                            2nd, the country held what the president promised 
                            to be democratic elections. </p>
                          <p align="left">It 
                            was quickly evident that Mr. Shevardnadze also failed 
                            to follow through with this promise and Georgians 
                            turned up by the thousands to protest rigged results 
                            and broken promises. The people adopted the slogan 
                            of Otpor, a student activist group &#8211; Kmara, 
                            which means &#8220;Enough is enough&#8221; and stormed 
                            the Georgian parliament. The president agreed to resign 
                            the last week of November, making Georgia&#8217;s 
                            biggest power transition in a decade a bloodless one, 
                            earning it the name &#8220;the velvet revolution&#8221;. 
                            Nino Burjanadze, the speaker of the last parliament 
                            and one of the opposition leaders, was then sworn 
                            in as the temporary president.</p>

                                transitions: </strong>Georgia remains precariously 
                                balanced between several pressing issues, such 
                                as climbing poverty and escalating conflict with 
                                the province of Abkhazia, which may seize this 
                                opportunity to break with Georgia permanently. 
                                Although the revolution was successful, there 
                                is much work to be done, including a reconstruction 
                                of the Georgian government. Please pray for God&#8217;s

                                Georgia lives below the poverty line and pensioners 
                                survive on $6 US/month. The country is also made 
                                of many different ethnic groups which do not always 
                                co-exist peacefully. Please pray that the church 
                                would be a source of stability and peace in this
