<p>
Remnant Westside Church (RWC) is an AMI church plant, located in New York City, targeted at college students and young adults.  Founded in 2003 and led by Pastor Bruce Yi, RWC exists to raise up a new generation, liberated and empowered by the gospel, who will in turn radically impact their communities.  Through their ministries in small groups, worship times, on campuses, through missions, and engagement with the community in New York, RWC seeks to welcome people into a body of Christ focused on His glory.
<p>
<b>Please pray for:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>The growth of the various ministries at the church.</b> RWC has one ministry called AHAV, a Hebrew word for “love”.  AHAV’s focus is bringing a gospel of hope and love to their local community by reaching poor and needy people, as well as mentoring children and youth.  Pray that AHAV, along with the rest of their ministries, would bear great fruit for God’s glory.</li>
<li><b>The leadership of the church.</b>  Pray that Pastor Bruce would continue receiving God’s anointing of vision in his leadership, and that the staff would be open and listening to the Spirit.  Pray for current and future leaders in that young church that will invest into God’s kingdom work there.</li>
<li><b>The greater glory of God through the RWC as a fellow church in AMI.</b>  The AMI community of churches provides context within which to pray for our brothers and sisters all around the world with a unified spirit for a joint vision.  Pray that RWC would be used to fulfill God’s glorious plan within its position for the vision of AMI.</li>
