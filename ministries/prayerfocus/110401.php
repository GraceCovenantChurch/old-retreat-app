                          <p align="left">Followers 
                            of Jesus Christ around the world are persecuted simply 
                            for their belief and trust in Christ. According to 
                            the United States State Department, Christians in 
                            over 60 countries face daily the realities of massacre, 
                            rape, torture, mutilation, family division, harassment, 
                            imprisonment, slavery, discrimination in education 
                            and employment, and even death. </p>
                          <p align="left">The 
                            International Day of Prayer (IDOP) is a global day 
                            of intercession for persecuted Christians worldwide. 
                            Its primary focus is the work of intercessory prayer 
                            and citizen action on behalf of persecuted communities 
                            of the Christian faith. Prayer is also encouraged 
                            for the souls of the oppressors, the nations that 
                            promote persecution, and those who ignore it. </p>
                          <p align="left">Begun 
                            in 1996, IDOP is a rallying point for Christians and 
                            others to stand behind those who suffer for their 
                            faith by providing prayer support and appropriate 
                            advocacy. It is expected that over 100,000 churches 
                            in the United States and 300,000 worldwide will pray 
                            together today for their persecuted brethren. </p>
                          <p align="left">As 
                            a church, Grace Covenant would also like to keep them 
                            in prayer. Below is a profile on one country in particular 
                            where Christians have recently experienced increased 
                            hardship due to the current attacks in neighboring 
                            Afghanistan..</p>

                            Islamic extremism is on the rise as Afghan refugees 
                            stream into the country. Taliban-influenced groups 
                            have issued death threats to pastors and other Christian 
                            leaders. Some Christians were fired from their jobs 
                            after Islamic leaders urged faithful Muslims to separate 
                            themselves from the infidels (i.e. non-Muslims). </p>
                          <p align="left">Christians 
                            have increasingly been told to go to America if they 
                            want to practice their faith. Last Sunday, terrorists 
                            killed 15 Christians during a church service. It was 
                            also reported that several families were dragged from 
                            their homes and beaten by militant Muslims who were 
                            enraged by the events in Afghanistan. <br>
