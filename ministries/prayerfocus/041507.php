<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Summer Missions</span><br /><br />Every summer, GCC sends out short-term missions teams overseas to work with local churches in various ministries.  This year, GCC will be partnering with other AMI churches to send teams to Peru and Kenya.  The activities of the missions teams will include evangelism, church planting, and encouraging the local believers.  The team to Peru will go from July 5 to August 2, and the Kenya team will go from July 2 to August 2.  There will also be an inner city team that will work in Cincinnati, Ohio from July 19 to July 28.
<p>
Please pray for wisdom for the leaders, love for the people, fruitful training during the upcoming months, and vision into God’s heart for the people around the world.
