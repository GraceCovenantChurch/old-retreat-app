                          Paraguay 
                          has one of South America's most racially homogeneous 
                          populations and is one of the continent's least densely 
                          populated countries. It also experienced the region's 
                          longest dictatorship, under Alfredo Stroessner, who 
                          ruled for 35 years until 1989.<br>
                          <br>
                          The end of the Stroessner dictatorship did not bring 
                          political stability. Despite elections in 1993 and 1998, 
                          the army remains an influential force. Stroessner's 
                          party, the National Republican Association-Colorado 
                          Party, continues to rule, and factional splits have 
                          resulted in the assassination of a vice-president, the 
                          resignation of a president and an attempted coup. <br>

                              Stability:</strong> 
                              Lacking significant mineral resources, Paraguay's 
                              economy is largely agricultural and, despite slow 
                              but steady growth since the early 1990s, remains 
                              fragile.<br>

                              Families:</strong> 
                              However, the commercialization of agriculture, high 
                              population growth and forest clearance have led 
                              to a dramatic increase in the number of landless 
                              families. <br>
                              <br>

                              Disparity:</strong> This, in turn, has boosted migration 
                              into urban areas, causing a rapid growth in shanty 
                              towns. Thus, an already large wealth gap is increasing, 
                              with an estimated 60% of urban and 80% of rural 
                              dwellers living below the poverty line. </li>
