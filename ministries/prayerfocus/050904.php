                          FRESHMAN/SOPHOMORE RETREAT: 5/9-5/11</strong><br>
                          The annual freshman sophomore retreat is now in its 
                          third year and has always been a time of spiritual renewal 
                          and fellowship among underclassmen. The freshmen and 
                          sophomores will leave this afternoon and come back on 
                          Tuesday evening.</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li> 
                            Please pray that God would work through the freshmen 
                            and sophomores who attend to love Him more and love 
                            others as they experience God&#8217;s love.<br>
                            <br>
                            </li>
                          <li> 
                            Please pray for the logistics of the retreat: the 
                            rides, the games, the speaker, the cabin arrangements. 
                            We would like every aspect of the retreat to worship 
                            God in every way possible.<br>

                        <p><strong>THE 
                          GRADUATES: May and June</strong><br>
                          Every year, our church bids farewell to many who have 
                          spent several years growing in Christ and sharing God&#8217;s 
                          love with us. They are either graduating from school 
                          or leaving the area; some are even scattering across 
                          the globe. For all the graduates, we hope that they 
                          will continue to live for Jesus in all that they do. 
                          <br>

                        <ul>
                          <li>Please 
                            pray that God would give the graduates strength and 
                            courage as they prepare to leave and that they would 
                            learn to live by the Spirit.<br>

                            Please pray that the graduates would find communities 
                            of believers whom they can learn from and serve. <br>
