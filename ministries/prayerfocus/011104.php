                          annual Congregational Retreat will be held from Friday, 
                          January 23 to Saturday, January 24 at Springton Lake 
                          Presbyterian Church. The retreat is a great way to start 
                          off the new year by worshipping God and seeking renewal 
                          as a church. It also provides ways to fellowship with 
                          other members of both the Emmaus and the Harvest groups 
                          through small group sessions and fun games.</p>

                              adults as we seek God together through prayer and 
                              praise, small group discussion, and the Word.<br>

                              Baptism:</strong> Members of our congregation will 
                              be baptized at the retreat. Please pray that God 
                              would work powerfully in their lives as they dedicate 
                              themselves to Him<br>

                              pray for the logistics of the retreat including 
                              rides, registration, and other administrative details<br>

                              Prayer and Praise: </strong>Although 
                              there is great fellowship, the retreat provides 
                              a great opportunity to spend time alone with God. 
                              Please pray that those who attend will become closer 
                              to God through thanking and worshipping Him. </li>
