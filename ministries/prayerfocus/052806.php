<p>
The vision of the Church of Southland, in Southern California, is to join God in His redemptive work by serving this generation by the power of the Holy Spirit.  They desire to be a Word-based, Spirit-driven church engaging in evangelism and missions, deeming every believer a minister.  The church targets a diversity of groups focused on young adults, college students, youth, non-believers, women’s and men’s ministries.  Programs like Simply Southland, GIG’s, ALPHA, and various classes engage the Church of Southland with the connections its members have with the community.
<p>
<b>Please pray for:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>The growth of the various ministries at the church.</b> Please pray for the ministries that reach out to new believers and edify members in the church for greater fruit and a worshipful harvest.  Pray that their efforts to reach the community and build the body of Christ would find blessing.</li>
<li><b>The leadership of the church.</b>  Pray that Pastor Keith would continue to be anointed in his vision for the church and that the staff would have open hearts listening to the Spirit of God.  Pray especially for Pastor Sung Chung as he prepares to depart for China.</li>
<li><b>The greater glory of God through the Church of Southland as a fellow church in AMI.</b>  The AMI network offers us an exciting opportunity to pray for our brothers and sisters all around the world with a unified spirit for our joint vision.  Pray that Southland Church would be used to fulfill God’s glorious plan within its position for the vision of AMI.</li>
