                        <p align="left">After 
                          lurching from one military coup to another, Nigeria 
                          now has an elected leadership. But it faces the growing 
                          challenge of preventing Africa's most populous country 
                          from breaking apart along ethnic and religious lines.<br>

                          <strong>NIGERIA FACTS</strong><br>
                          Population: 115 million <br>
                          Capital: Abuja <br>
                          Major languages: English (official), Yoruba, Ibo, Hausa 
                          <br>
                          Major religions: Islam, Christianity, indigenous beliefs 
                          <br>
                          Life expectancy: 54 years (men), 56 years (women) <br>
                          Monetary unit: 1 Nigerian naira = 100 kobo<br>
                          Main exports: Petroleum, petroleum products, cocoa, 
                          rubber <br>
                          Average annual income: US $260 <br>
                          <br>
                          Political liberalization ushered in by the return to 
                          civilian rule in 1999 has allowed militants from religious 
                          and ethnic groups to express their frustrations more 
                          freely, and with increasing violence. Thousands of people 
                          have already died over the past few years in communal 
                          rivalry. Separatist aspirations among some groups have 
                          been growing, prompting reminders of the bitter civil 
                          war over the breakaway Biafran republic in the late 
                          1960s. <br>

                              for Christians:</strong> The imposition of Islamic 
                              law in several states has embedded divisions and 
                              caused thousands of Christians to flee. <br>

                              government:</strong> The government is under pressure 
                              to improve the economy, which experienced an oil 
                              boom in the 1970s, but which has been severely undermined 
                              by corruption and mismanagement. <br>

                              economy:</strong> Nigeria is keen to attract foreign 
                              investment but is hindered in this quest by security 
                              concerns as well as by a shaky infrastructure troubled 
                              by power cuts. <br>
