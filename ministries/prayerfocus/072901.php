                          brothers and sisters from our church will be leaving 
                          to minister to the people of the Kensington region, 
                          located in Northeast Philadelphia. For the next six 
                          days our team will be partnering with Inner City Missions 
                          - a local minister dedicated to bringing the message 
                          of the Gospel to the people of Kensington - to serve 
                          the LORD and the local people through Vacation Bible 
                          School (VBS), street evangalism, and youth programs.</p>
                        <p align="left">Our 
                          team is composed of Philip Choe, Euree Choi, Haesook 
                          Hong, Eun Koh, Hobart Lee, Lolise Mbi, and Steve Shin, 
                          and will be lead by Dan Ameresekere. Throughout the 
                          following week they will be sharing the Gospel to people 
                          whose lives and circumstances may be very different 
                          from many of our own. Therefore, as a bosy we would 
                          like to partner with our Inner City Missions team, through 
                          prayer, as they prepare to serve the children, the sick, 
                          the homeless, drug addicted and the other citizens of 
                          the area.</p>

                          <li><strong>Brokenness 
                            and Compassion: </strong>Please pray that the LORD 
                            would give our team His heart for the people of Kensington, 
                            as it will be the LORD's love and compassion which 
                            will sustain the desire in our team to serve the people.<br>

                            the LORD would move powerfully in the hearts of the 
                            people of Kensington and our team. Pray also that 
                            our team would be utterly dependant on the LORD, as 
                            ultimately it is only He who can save.<br>

                            Many people in Kensington live and work in circumstances 
                            that are foreign to many of us. Our missions team 
                            will encounter abandoned/orphaned children, the sick, 
                            drug addicts, prostitutes, etc. Pray that they, just 
                            like us, would see their need for the Savior, and 
                            pray that a great multitude of people would commit 
                            their lives to Christ.<br>

                            pray for the ongoing work of Inner City Missions as 
                            they serve the area year round. Pray especially for 
                            Pastor Frank Vega, the founder of Inner City Missions. 
                            Pray that the LORD would provide for all the needs 
                            of the minister, pray for safety and protection upon 
                            him and his wife, Carmen, and pray that the LORD would 
                            use this ministry mightily to impact the area.</li>
