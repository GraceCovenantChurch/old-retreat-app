                        <p align="left">Once 
                          hailed as a model of stability, Ivory Coast has slipped 
                          into the kind of internal strife that has plagued many 
                          African countries.<br>
                          In September 2002 a troop mutiny escalated into a full-scale 
                          rebellion, voicing the ongoing discontent of northern 
                          Muslims. Thousands were killed in the conflict. Although 
                          the fighting has stopped temporarily, Ivory Coast remains 
                          divided.</p>
                        <p align="left">Peacekeepers 
                          patrol the buffer zone which separates the rebel-held 
                          north and the government-controlled south. Political 
                          efforts to reunite the nation have so far failed. </p>
