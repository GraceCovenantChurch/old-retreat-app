                          Katrina Relief - September 04, 2005</strong></p>
                        <p align="left">This 
                          past week, Hurricane Katrina swept through the Gulf 
                          Coast regionin the southern United States. 
                          The death toll is projected to be in the thousands. 
                          There is currently mass panic over the area, and the 
                          high concentrations of people, inefficient distribution 
                          of aid, and a general attitude of unrest have given 
                          rise to instances of looting, rape, and murder. Hospitals 
                          and aid centers have exhausted their supplies; as a 
                          result, scarcity evokes widespread desperation that 
                          fosters a spirit of anarchy. </p>
                        <p><strong>Please 
                          pray for:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>The 
                            survivors who suffered a total loss of everything 
                            they owned, as well as many who lost their loved ones 
                            before their own eyes. Pray that God would heal 
                            their souls and plant resolve in their hearts.<br>
                            <br>

                            and organized dispersion of aid in this critical time 
                            where dehydration and malnourishment is leaving people 
                            dead in the streets.<br>
                            <br>
                            </li>
                          <li>Pray 
                            also that God would place a spirit of serving and 
                            carrying each other&#8217;s burdens among the communities 
                            nearby as they take in refugees.<br>

                            that God would defend the vulnerable from evil and 
                            that this time of chaos would be room for God to write 
                            a great redemption story.</li>
