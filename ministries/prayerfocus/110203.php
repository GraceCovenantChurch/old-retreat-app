                            of Samaritan&#8217;s Purse</strong><br>
                            After visiting suffering children on the Korean island 
                            of Kojedo, Dr. Bob Pierce wrote in his Bible, &#8220;Let 
                            my heart be broken for the things that break the heart 
                            of God. This prayer eventually led him, in 1970, to 
                            found the ministry of Samaritan&#8217;s Purse, a non-denominational 
                            Christian evangelical organization with a vision of 
                            providing spiritual and physical aid to victims of 
                            war, poverty, natural disasters, disease, and famine 
                            with the purpose of sharing God's love through His 
                            Son, Jesus Christ. It is currently under the leadership 
                            of Franklin Graham, the fourth of five children born 
                            to evangelist Billy Graham and his wife Ruth.</p>
                          <p align="left"><strong>Purpose</strong><br>
                            Every year, Samaritan&#8217;s Purse sponsors an event 
                            called Operation Christmas Child in which shoeboxes 
                            filled with gifts are collected and distributed to 
                            needy children around the world. Each shoebox also 
                            includes Christian literature to help these children 
                            understand the true meaning of Christmas and see that 
                            the greatest gift of all was Jesus Christ himself.</p>

                                the appropriate age group such as 2-4, 5-9, or 
                                10-14.</li>
