                          <p align="left"><strong>History<br>
                            </strong>Haiti has the distinction of being the world&#8217;s 
                            first black-led republic and the first state in the 
                            Caribbean to achieve independence. This rich, tropical 
                            climate and exotic culture, largely epitomized by 
                            voodoo, promised to make this country a popular tourist 
                            destination. </p>
                          <p align="left">However, 
                            since the 1980&#8217;s, Haiti has also been characterized 
                            by brutal dictatorships and extreme political and 
                            economic instability. In 1990, Jean-Bertrand Aristide 
                            became Haiti&#8217;s first democratically &#8211; 
                            elected President and brought with him great hopes 
                            for a better future. However, more than a decade later, 
                            Haiti remains the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere 
                            with a tattered infrastructure and a justice system 
                            completely corrupted by drug-trafficking.</p>
                          <p align="left">Last 
                            Friday, thousands of demonstrators &#8211; most of 
                            them students &#8211; marched on the National Palace 
                            in one of the largest anti-government demonstrations 
                            in years. The students marched to protest President 
                            Aristide&#8217;s poor leadership in issues such as 
                            police corruption, soaring unemployment, a lagging 
                            economy, among many other things.</p>

                              <li><strong>Leadership: 
                                </strong>One of Haiti&#8217;s biggest social problems 
                                is the widening gap between the French speaking 
                                elite and the Creole speaking majority. Roughly 
                                1% of the population controls 50% of all of Haiti&#8217;s 
                                wealth as well as holds the keys to political 
                                power. Aristide rose to power as a champion of 
                                the poor but has since had much difficulty battling 
                                the conservative leaders and his political stance 
                                has made him the target of several assassination 
                                attempts. Please pray for God to bring about social 
                                justice and leaders that long for the good of 
                                the country rather than their own advancement.<br>

                              <li> <strong>The 
                                Church: </strong> Haiti is a country deeply rooted 
                                in both Roman Catholicism and voodoo. Many missionaries 
                                there describe Haiti as 90% Christian and 100% 
                                voodoo. Recently, Aristide just agreed to give 
                                voodoo official status, meaning things such as 
                                voodoo marriage ceremonies carry the same legal 
                                weight as their Catholic counterparts. <br>
                                <br>
                                However, Aristide, himself formerly a Roman Catholic 
                                priest, is a strong supporter of &#8220;liberation 
                                theology&#8221;, which calls the church to engage 
                                in social problems such as poverty and oppression. 
                                Please pray that the church will be a Godly influence 
                                in Haiti, both socially and spiritually.</li>
