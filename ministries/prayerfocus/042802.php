                          In this week's Prayer Focus, we would like to recognize 
                          our graduates and those leaving the area. We praise 
                          the LORD for the work He has done in their lives and 
                          for sustaining them during their time at GCC. We would 
                          especially like to cover these brothers and sisters 
                          in our prayers – that the Lord’s Spirit would be upon 
                          them as they journey to the next phase of their lives. 
                          Listed below are the names of those graduating or leaving 
                          the area. Please pray for them as they follow the Lord.

                              area, that wherever they may go, they will find 
                              comfort knowing the Lord is with them. Also pray 
                              that they would find churches through which they 
                              can grow and faithfully serve the Lord. <br>
