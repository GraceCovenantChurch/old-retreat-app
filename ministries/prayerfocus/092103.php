                            Landlocked in the Himalayas, Nepal is a popular destination 
                            for travelers seeking to climb the heights of Mount 
                            Everest and enjoy the country&#8217;s fantastic scenery 
                            and rich cultural mix of Hinduism and Buddhism. However, 
                            it remains one of the poorest countries in the world, 
                            dominated for many years by a rigid monarchy. Just 
                            10 years ago, democracy was introduced into Nepal 
                            converting the government into a constitutional monarchy. 
                            In the years since, the government changed hands numerous 
                            times and the politic groups remain extremely factionalized.</p>

                            years ago, a group of Communist rebels who claim to 
                            have been inspired by China&#8217;s Chairman Mao, 
                            created a highly organized insurgency and have since 
                            then waged &#8220;the people&#8217;s war&#8221; against 
                            the monarchy. They have modeled themselves after the 
                            Maoist Shining Path guerillas in Peru and about 8,000 
                            people have died in the fighting. They currently control 
                            40% of the country. </p>

                            recently, they have ordered the public to heed a general 
                            strike against the government, bringing normal life 
                            in Nepal to a standstill. This strike comes after 
                            seven months of truce and several weeks of violence 
                            filled peace negotiations. The rebels call for an 
                            end to the monarchy while the royal family refuses 
                            to budge and demand the rebels to conform their desires 
                            to the current laws. In light of this situation, let 
                            us together as one body in Christ lift up prayers 
                            for&#8230;</p>

                                The leaders:</strong> Last year, one of Nepal&#8217;s 
                                royal princes shot and killed himself, the King, 
                                Queen and seven other members of the royal family 
                                in an alcohol and drug induced rampage. The current 
                                King Gyanendra is said to be a capable but stubborn 
                                man. The leader of the rebels is a man known as 
                                Prachanda which means &#8220;the fierce one&#8221;. 
                                Neither side has made a move towards compromise 
                                and many fear the return of all-out fighting.<br>
                                <br>

                                The people:</strong> 
                                About 45% of Nepal&#8217;s people live below the 
                                poverty line and 80% live off of subsistence farming. 
                                However, the fighting and poor management of resources 
                                are destroying Nepal&#8217;s environment. In this 
                                current strike, almost everyone is too afraid 
                                of the rebels to work and dozens have died in 
                                just the past few days.</li>
