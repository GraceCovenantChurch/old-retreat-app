                        <p align="left">Recently, 
                          Bolivian protesters have been causing social unrest 
                          due to its criticism of the Bolivian governance over 
                          natural resources such as oil and coca, the country&#8217;s 
                          main source of revenue. <br>
                          As a result, the Bolivian president Mesa has resigned 
                          and been replaced by caretaker President Rodriguez. 
                          President Rodriguez has called for elections and a referendum 
                          on the oil issue.</p>
                        <p align="left">Bolivia 
                          is also one of the poorest countries in South America. 
                          Whereas wealthy city elites, who are mostly of Spanish 
                          ancestry, have traditionally dominated political and 
                          economic life, the majority of Bolivians are low-income 
                          subsistence farmers, miners, small traders or artisans.</p>
