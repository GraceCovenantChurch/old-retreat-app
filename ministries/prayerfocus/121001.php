                            <br>
                            </b>As 
                            a church, one of the most important events of the 
                            year is the annual congregational retreat. The congregational 
                            retreat provides an excellent opportunity for church 
                            members to get away from the business of daily life 
                            and spend time in worshipping and being renewed by 
                            God while fellowshipping with other church members. 
                            This coming retreat will take place from January 25th 
                            - 27th at NJ Christian Academy.</span></p>
