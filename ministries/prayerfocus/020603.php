                          The 
                          division of the former British mandate of Palestine 
                          and the creation of the state of Israel in the years 
                          after the end of World War II have been at the heart 
                          of Middle Eastern conflicts for the past half century. 
                          The creation of Israel was the culmination of the Zionist 
                          movement, whose aim was a homeland for Jews scattered 
                          all over the world following the Diaspora. After the 
                          Nazi Holocaust, pressure grew for the international 
                          recognition of a Jewish state, and in 1948 Israel came 
                          into being. </P>
