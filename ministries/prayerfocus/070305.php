                        <p align="left">This 
                          summer God has provided Grace Covenant Church the means 
                          to send out two missions teams&#8212;one to Peru and 
                          another to Micronesia. The teams left last Sunday for 
                          a one week training session in Michigan before heading 
                          off to their respective mission fields.</p>
                        <p align="left">While 
                          in these countries the teams will have the opportunity 
                          tell many people about our Savior Jesus Christ. In doing 
                          so the teams will undoubtedly be stretched while facing 
                          many new tasks and challenges. We should lift up our 
                          brothers and sisters in prayer and ask God to help them 
                          and empower them to do His work.<br>
                          <br>
                           </p>
                        <p><strong>Prayer 
                          Requests:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Focus: 
                            Please pray that the missions teams will keep 
                            their focus on God and doing His will while on these 
                            trips.<br>
                            <br>
                            </li>
                          <li>Strength: 
                            For many of the members this will be the first time 
                            on the mission field. Please pray to God asking for 
                            strength for the teams to do His work.<br>
                            <br>
                            </li>
                          <li>Hearts: 
                            Pray that God will use this time to give the 
                            members a heart for serving God and spreading His 
                            word. Also pray that God will open up the hearts of 
                            the people in these countries allowing them to accept 
                            Jesus as their Savior.<br>
                            <br>
                            </li>
                          <li>Team 
                            Unity: Pray that as the teams spend time together 
                            that they may grow together and support one another. 
                            For it's by the way Christians love one another that 
                            the world understands God's love for His people.</li>
