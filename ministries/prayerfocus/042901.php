                          this week's Prayer Focus, we would like to congratulate 
                          our graduates. We would also like to praise the LORD 
                          for the work He has done in their lives and for sustaining 
                          them during their time here at GCC. As a body we would 
                          like to cover these brothers and sisters in our prayers 
                          so that the LORD's Spirit would be upon them as they 
                          prepare to face the next phase of their lives, whatever 
                          that may be. <br>

                          Some of our college graduates will be entering the workforce, 
                          while others will be continuing their education in graduate 
                          schools. Those finishing graduate school will be working 
                          in various areas of the country. Listed below are the 
                          names of all of our graduating class of 2001. Let us 
                          pray for them as they continue to walk with the LORD.</p>

                              the next phase of their lives. As mentioned before,

                              and others will be going back to school. Whatever 
                              the case, let's pray that the LORD would continue 
                              to reveal His presence to them as they make their 
                              respective transitions.<br>

                              still uncertain as to their immediate future plans. 
                              Pray that they will have wisdom as they try to discern 
                              God’s will. Pray also that the peace of God will 
                              comfort them during this time.<br>

                              area. Pray that wherever they may go, our graduates 
                              will be comforted in knowing that the Lord will 
                              be with them. Pray also that our brothers and sisters 
                              would find churches through which they can grow 
                              and faithfully serve the Lord. <br>

                              trials and temptations. Pray that our graduates, 
                              especially those entering the marketplace will develop 
                              and live out Godly convictions. <br>
