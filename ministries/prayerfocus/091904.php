                          <strong>About the elections:</strong><br>
                          The upcoming November election day is an event that 
                          will define the future of our country and arguably, 
                          the world. For Christians, it is important to exercise 
                          our civic duty if we are US citizens by voting. As members 
                          of a democracy, we have a say in the environment we 
                          live in and have a choice as to what matters in society 
                          today. </p>
                        <p>The 
                          presidential candidates this year are the incumbent 
                          President Bush (R-TX) and Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts 
                          (D-MA). In Pennsylvania, candidates for the Senate and 
                          House of Representatives will also be decided. </p>
                        <p>The 
                          candidates for the senate are: Arlen Specter (R) and 
                          Joe Hoeffel (D). </p>
                        <p>The 
                          last day to register for the November 2 election in 
                          PA is October 4 so please remember to do so.</p>
