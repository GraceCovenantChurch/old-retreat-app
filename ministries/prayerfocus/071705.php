                        <p align="left">Last 
                          week, raiders descended on the village of Turbi and 
                          massacred 76 people in what has been termed as &#8220;revenge 
                          attacks&#8221;. The attack was a gruesome slaughter, 
                          with 22 children among the dead. President Mwai Kibaki 
                          appealed for calm, but tension is familiar to many who 
                          live near the Ethiopian border. In an unrelated event, 
                          Catholic bishop Luigi Locati was killed in northern 
                          Kenya. The perpetrator&#8217;s identity and the motive 
                          remain unclear. </p>
                        <p align="left">Kenya, 
                          though an advanced hub for commerce in Africa, has recently 
                          been slowed by the AIDS pandemic, corruption and violent 
                          unrest. The major religion in Kenya is Christianity 
                          and some schools of missions strategy have viewed Kenya 
                          as a doorway into other areas of Africa. But as the 
                          nation continues to suffer, the healing of the Kenyan 
                          people and the ministry to the continent are strained. 
                          Incidents stemming from internal strife like the massacre 
                          in Turbi damage national stability and morale.<br>
