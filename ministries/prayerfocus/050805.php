                        <p align="left">On 
                          Saturday, three explosions hit busy shopping areas in 
                          the Burmese capital of Rangoon, reportedly killing several 
                          people and injuring others. The shopping areas included 
                          two supermarkets and a trade fair, which were bustling 
                          with people.<br>

                        <p align="left">Burma 
                          is ruled by a military junta which has been accused 
                          of gross human rights abuses, including the forcible 
                          relocation of civilians and the widespread use of forced 
                          labour, which includes children. The armed forces - 
                          and former rebels co-opted by the government - have 
                          been accused of large-scale trafficking in heroin, of 
                          which Burma is a major exporter. Prostitution and AIDS 
                          are major problems.<br>

                          There are many minority groups, the largest of which 
                          is the Burman people, who are ethnically related to 
                          the Tibetans and the Chinese. Burman dominance over 
                          Karen, Shan, Rakhine, Mon, Chin, Kachin and other minorities 
                          has been the source of considerable ethnic tension, 
                          fuelling intermittent separatist rebellions.<br>
