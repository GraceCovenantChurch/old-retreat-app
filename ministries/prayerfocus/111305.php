<p>
<p>
Last Wednesday night, suicide bombs killed more than 50 in Amman, the capital of Jordan.  Although Jordan is located in a turbulent region in the Middle East (between Israel and Iraq), these bombings shocked the nation.  The suicide bombs were detonated at three major hotels in Amman: the Radisson SAS, the Grand Hyatt, and the Days Inn.  Among the dead are two Palestinian officials, two Americans, and a Hollywood movie producer.  Al-Qaeda has claimed responsibility for the incident, and worldwide responses to these terrorist acts have reflected serious pledges of support.  
<p>
Please pray for:
<p>
<ul>
 <li><b>Comfort to those who lost beloved ones.</b>  One of the bombings was located at a wedding party, where shrapnel killed one parent of each the bride and the groom.  Pray that survivors would not seek vengeance but contemplate the brevity of life and engage in a mood of spiritual reflection.</li>
 <li><b>An immediate and swift end to all such terrorist activity, worldwide.</b>  Please pray that peacemakers would arise in the midst of volatility, advocating justice and life instead of hatred and death.  Pray that God would enact a non-hostile resolution instead of heated escalation.</li>
 <li><b>God’s blessing for the nation of Jordan.</b>  In the past century, Jordan has existed as a place of stability in the region, slowly moving in order to remedy economic difficulties.  Pray that Jordan would continue to grow in its openness and participation in the global community, so that God would build His church and use Jordan as a beacon for its neighboring countries.</li>
