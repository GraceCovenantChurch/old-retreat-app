<p>
A great way to start off the new year is to get away from the daily grind and spend quality time with fellow brothers and sisters.  GCC’s college students will go on a retreat from January 26-28 at the New Jersey Christian Academy.  The annual retreat will feature Pastor Barry Kang of the Church of Southland as the main speaker.
<p>
<b>Prayer Requests:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Pastor Barry Kang:</b> Pray for wisdom and truth when Pastor Barry preaches.</li>
<li><b>Band:</b> The praise band will be challenged physically and spiritually as it leads worship during the retreat.  Pray that the band’s preparation is diligent and that each member carries a heart of worship into and throughout the retreat.  Also pray for logistical and technical issues.</li>
<li><b>Health:</b> The physical demands of a retreat in the winter are substantial.  Pray for the health of everyone involved, and that any discomfort may not get in the way of spiritual growth or blessings.</li>
<li><b>Fellowship:</b> Pray that the weekend is filled with times of learning, prayer, and good fellowship, as people draw closer to God together.  Pray that GCC more strongly resembles the body of Christ after this retreat.</li>
</ul>
