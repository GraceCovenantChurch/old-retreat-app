                            Groups represent an integral part to Grace Covenant 
                            Church’s ministry. They constitute the heart of the 
                            church, the building blocks of the larger church community. 
                            Family groups meet to not only study the Bible but 
                            also provide support for one another through Biblical 
                            friendship, encouragement and accountability. If you 
                            are interested in learning about or getting more involved 
                            with Grace Covenant Church, we invite you to join 
                            a family group. If you are a member of another fellowship 
                            or church, we would encourage you to join one of their 
                            small groups. Listed below are some prayer requests 
                            as well as family group contact information:
