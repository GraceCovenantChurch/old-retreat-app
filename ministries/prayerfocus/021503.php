                              -</strong> in a recent survey, of the approximately 
                              150 who turned in info sheets, roughly 25% stated 
                              that they did not have a relationship with God. 
                              The Lord has given our church a great opportunity 
                              to share the Gospel with non-Christians. Pray 
                              that we can be faithful in that task. (Matthew 28:18-20)

                              Spiritual hunger -</strong> pray that the people 
                              of our church would have a heart desire that can 
                              only be satisfied in the Lord. Pray that prayer 
                              especially for Mikyung and I, as we are firmly convicted 
                              that the best ministry we can give is to be a couple 
                              who loves our Lord with all that we are. (Matthew 
                              22:37-38)<br>

                              growth -</strong> many of the believers here are 
                              young in the faith (a good number having come to 
                              faith in college through the church). We're 
                              in the process of training leaders. As the 
                              church grows larger, the small group ministry becomes 
                              all the more important. Pray that the Lord 
                              would raise up men and women of God to serve His 
                              church. (Matthew 9:37-38)<br>

                              Pastor Paul Chi speaking</strong> - Pray that it 
                              will be a good time in the Spirit, with people being 
                              convicted by the Word, learning what it means to 
                              be excited for the Lord, and developing a heart 
                              to really live for Him.<br>

                              Lord. Also, pray for us as our family grows, 
                              that the Lord will continue to provide for all our
