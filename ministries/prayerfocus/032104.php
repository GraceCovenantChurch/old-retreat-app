                        <p align="left">On 
                          Thursday, March 11th, 10 bombs exploded simultaneously 
                          on 4 separate commuter trains during a busy morning 
                          rush hour. The bombs were placed so that they would 
                          detonate as each train arrived at Atocha train station 
                          in Madrid, presumably to maximize damage done by each 
                          bomb. All told, more than 200 people died and more than 
                          1400 were injured in that day&#8217;s events. This day 
                          has shaken Spain to the core, making this day not only 
                          a national tragedy, but also a political and social 
                          turning point.</p>
                        <p align="left">At 
                          first the government pinned the blame on ETA, a Basque 
                          separatist group from the north of Spain that has been 
                          responsible for previous terror attacks, despite evidence 
                          that this was most likely the work of al-Qaeda or an 
                          affiliated group. </p>
                        <p align="left">There 
                          was a public outcry against the government and Prime 
                          Minister Aznar in particular, for actively deceiving 
                          the public in order to avoid criticism for Aznar&#8217;s 
                          support for President Bush&#8217;s war in Iraq, as well 
                          as for the presence of Spanish troops in Iraq. Just 
                          a few short days after the tragedy, Spain held its general 
                          elections during which Spaniards turned out in unprecedented 
                          numbers to vote in Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, the 
                          leader of Spain&#8217;s Socialist Party (PSOE). </p>
                        <p align="left"><strong>Please 
                          Pray</strong></p>

                              <strong>For the Victims and their Families: </strong>In 
                              this predominantly Catholic country, many people 
                              see religion as a irrelevant tradition or quaint 
                              past-time. Please pray that these people would not 
                              be content with simply superficial healing and that 
                              God can powerfully use this tragedy to draw His 
                              people closer to Himself.<br>

                              <strong>For the Leaders of Spain:</strong> This 
                              latest election will begin a period of significant 
                              political and social change for Spain as it transitions 
                              from traditional, conservative rule to a leftist, 
                              Socialist ruling party. Not only will Zapatero bring 
                              much needed economic and social reforms, he will 
                              also drastically change Spain&#8217;s stance on 
                              the international scene. For instance, Zapatero 
                              is opposed to any Spanish involvement in the war 
                              against terror and has already threatened to remove 
                              its troops from Iraq. Please pray for wisdom as 
                              the leaders bring Spain safely through this period 
                              of transition.<br>
                              <br>

                            <li> 
                              <strong>Unity and Peace:</strong> Spain has long 
                              been a very homogenous society as a result of Franco&#8217;s 
                              dictatorship. The people are unused to diversity 
                              and racism has long been a problem. Since these 
                              bombings, backlash against the Muslim community 
                              and other immigrant groups has been great. Please 
                              pray for a peace that is necessary for healing.<br>
                              <br>

                              <strong>For the War on Terror:</strong> Though Zapatero 
                              may be opposed to the war in Iraq, he is also opposed 
                              to terrorist activity and has pledged to fight against 
                              it. However, this recent change of government in 
                              Spain shows what kind of power terrorist groups 
                              can over a government. Please pray that the leaders 
                              would be wise in combating an elusive enemy. </li>
