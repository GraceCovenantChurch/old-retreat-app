                          year, our church says goodbye to the graduating class 
                          of seniors. Some of them have been with GCC for all 
                          of their undergraduate years but some of them have just 
                          started worshipping with us. Regardless of their length 
                          of time here, we hope that God filled these past few 
                          years with a great love and passion for His glory.</p>
                        <p align="left">As 
                          the graduates face joining the work force, going to 
                          graduate school, or maybe an undecided future, let&#8217;s 
                          continue to pray for them as a church.<br>

                            favor in their lives: Many of the graduates will definitely 
                            be leaving the area but some of them are still looking 
                            for jobs. Pray that God would bless them with the 
                            right jobs and opportunities.<br>

                            Transitioning into young adult life can be intimidating 
                            but also exciting. Pray that God would give them courage 
                            to face any challenges that might come their way.<br>
                            <br>

                          <li>Faithfulness: 
                            Pray that in whatever the graduates do, that they 
                            would worship and serve God faithfully. </li>
