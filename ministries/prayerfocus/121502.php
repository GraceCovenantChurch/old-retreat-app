                            off the southern tip of India, the tropical island 
                            of Sri Lanka has beguiled travelers for centuries 
                            with its palm-fringed beaches, diverse landscapes 
                            and historical monuments. But for nearly two decades, 
                            the island has been scarred by a bitter civil war 
                            arising out of ethnic tensions.</p>

                            island has a long-established Tamil minority in the 
                            north and east. The British also brought in Tamil 
                            laborers to work the coffee and tea plantations in 
                            the central highlands, making the island a major tea 
                            producer. But the majority Buddhist Sinhalese community 
                            resented what they saw as favoritism towards the mainly-Hindu 
                            Tamils under British administration. The growth of 
                            a more assertive Sinhala nationalism after independence 
                            fanned the flames of ethnic division until civil war 
                            erupted in the 1980s between Tamils pressing for self-rule 
                            and the government.</p>

                                A ceasefire signed in early 2002, and a breakthrough 
                                in the peace talks in December 2002 raised hopes 
                                for lasting peace between the government and rebels. 
                                It has given many Sri Lankans a respite from violence, 
                                at least for the time being.</li>
