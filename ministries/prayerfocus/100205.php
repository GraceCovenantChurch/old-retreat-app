                        <p>
The nation of Algeria, located in northern Africa, won independence about 45 years ago through a bitter revolution.  In its short history, Algeria has suffered a civil war that resulted in the gruesome murder of 100,000 civilians.  The nation is currently engaged in passing a referendum that would offer amnesty for many of the militant forces.  Though the Algerian vote reflected overwhelming support for the initiative, analysts question the voting, as no independent organizations monitored the vote.
<p>
Please pray for:
<p>
<ul><li><b>
 Justice in Algeria.</b>  Much of the nation is not completely aware of the number and the types of human rights violations they may be overlooking through this referendum.  Pray that the decisions made would reflect justice insofar as it may be had.
</li>
<li><b> The opening of foreign investment and tourism.</b>  Algeria is a relatively rich state, due to its high oil production.  Therefore, Western nations are focusing on Algeria.  Pray that the gospel would accompany the influx of trade to this nation with a less than 1% Christian population.
</li>
<li><b> God’s glory as He works in Algeria.</b>  During this precarious time of transition, pray that God would open doors in Algeria for His love and grace to infiltrate people’s hearts.  There is a fierce opposition to Christianity that is only now relenting, due to long and bitter memories of North African "Christian" conquests and colonialism.  Pray that Algeria would begin bearing kingdom fruit to the glory of God.
</li>
