                        <p align="left">Acts 
                          Ministries International (AMI) began in 2002 with a 
                          group of pastors who had a vision to restore the early 
                          church that was seen in Acts 2. We envision AMI to be 
                          more than a denomination or an association. It is a 
                          community of churches seeking to model the spirituality, 
                          vision, and partnership exemplified in the book of Acts. 
                          AMI is committed to developing disciples of Christ within 
                          our churches, as well as spreading the gospel message 
                          to un-reached people through church planting and missions 
                          work.</p>
                        <p align="left">The 
                          AMI Revolution retreat will bring together students 
                          from all of the AMI churches to join in a weekend of 
                          worship, prayer and fellowship. The retreat will take 
                          place from June 30-July 2 in Ann Arbor, Michigan.<br>

                          <li>Small 
                            groups: Pray that the small group times would 
                            bring unity and encouragement to all the attendees.<br>

                            Pray for the band as they lead the congregation 
                            in worship. Pray also that God will protect their 
                            hearts as they prepare.<br>

                            Please pray for the logistics of the retreat including

                          <li>The 
                            Pastors: Pray that God would empower them and 
                            use them as His mouthpiece as they share the Word 
                            of God.<br>

                            presence: Pray that AMI Revolution would be a place 
                            where Christians would be able to meet God and be 
                            blessed by His Spirit. Pray that they would know His 
                            will for them and inspire them to reach the nations 
                            for Christ.<br>
