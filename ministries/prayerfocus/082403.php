                        <p align="left">September 
                          historically has been a busy month for our church. We 
                          are thankful for the opportunity to minister to the 
                          influx of new students (both college and graduate) and 
                          working young professionals. Listed below is a brief 
                          summary of our upcoming events. It is our desire that 
                          the LORD would make Philadelphia a place of tremendous 
                          blessing and spiritual growth for those who are called 
                          to spend extended time here. </p>
                        <p align="left">There 
                          are many things to prepare and the leaders will be called 
                          to invest a lot of time and energy in the first few 
                          weeks. Please pray for the hearts of the leaders, that 
                          they will serve effectively and with a Christ-like attitude. 
                          </p>
