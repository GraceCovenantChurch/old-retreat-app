<p>
Kazakhstan is a diverse nation. The majority is ethnically Kazakh but Russians comprise just over a quarter, and smaller minorities of Ukrainians, Germans, Chechens, Kurds, Koreans and Central Asian ethnic groups account for the rest. It has been heavily influenced by Islam in the earliest centuries and more recently by the Soviet Union. When Kazakhstan and many other Central Asian nations, declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, it opened its doors to foreign investment and development.

<b>Prayer Requests:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>The economy</b>: The country still suffers from a disparity in income levels. Many in the oil business are rich but much of the country is still poor.</li>
<li><b>The AIDS epidemic</b>: The epidemic in Kazakhstan is gaining momentum. Pray that God would provide people to work with the Kazakh citizens to offer hope.</li>
<li><b>Christian workers in Kazakhstan</b>: Pray that God would provide Kazakhstan with dedicated Christian workers and that the ones there would be encouraged to spread the Gospel. Pray for Pastor's Young's trip to Kazakhstan and that his Old Testament survey would equip leaders there to be even more ready to teach others about Christ.</li>
