                        <p>Founded 
                          by Benjamin Franklin, the University of Pennsylvania 
                          has become a hub of research and scholarship for many 
                          disciplines of study. Penn offers 12 different schools 
                          for undergraduate, graduate and continuing education 
                          to its students. Penn students come from all over the 
                          United States as well as from different corners of the 
                          world to study not only business and science, but also 
                          interdisciplinary fields. </p>
                        <p>Classes

                          <li><strong>The 
                            discipleship of Christians:</strong> Penn students 
                            have traditionally composed a large portion of the 
                            GCC fellowship. Pray that in addition to coming to 
                            church, that students would truly live for God in 
                            their everyday lives.<br>

                            fellowship of believers, there are a significant number 
                            of other Christian groups on campus. Pray that Christians 
                            at both GCC and the other groups would be dedicated 
                            to the spreading of the Gospel this year. </li>
