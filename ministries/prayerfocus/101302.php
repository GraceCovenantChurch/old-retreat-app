                            - October 13, 2002</strong><br>
                            <br>
                            Kensington 
                            is located in Northeast Philadelphia. Like other inner 
                            city areas, it is associated with poverty, abuse, 
                            crime and drugs. The area is often seen as a hopeless 
                            community of broken people, but God is working powerfully 
                            there.</p>
                          <p align="left">For 
                            the past three summers, our church has had the privilege 
                            of partnering with Pastor Frank Vega sending missions 
                            teams and tutors to Kensington. For the third year, 
                            God has opened the doors for our church to serve the 
                            people of Kensington through the Tutoring and Mentoring 
                            program. Through building relationships and through 
                            the Gospel of Jesus Christ, we hope to impact the 
                            lives of the children and to influence their parents.</p>

                                for open hearts towards the Gospel and for acceptance 
                                of Jesus Christ as their Savior. For may who live 
                                as drug addicts, prostitutes and alcoholics, God 
                                is their only hope for healing and change.<br>

                                Pray that God would work powerfully through the 
                                lives of the children and that they would experience 
                                the love of Christ. Pray that God would use the 
                                children to carry the Good News of the Gospel 
                                home to their families.<br>

                                Tutors and Mentors: </strong>Pray God would call 
                                his people to serve in His kingdom and that He 
                                would open up doors for people to commit their 
                                time and hearts. Also pray that they have servants' 
                                hearts of humility, sacrifice, compassion and 
                                patience.<br>

                                in Kensington: </strong>Pray that God would continue 
                                to strengthen and to empower Pastor Frank Vega 
                                as he ministers to the community. Pray for safety 
                                and protection for him and his family as they 
                                continue to live among the people they serve. 
                                Also pray for Ed Sul as he spends another year 
                                as an intern at Inner City Missions.</li>
