                            January 30, the Iraqi people will vote for a new representative 
                            government. Voters will choose 275 members of a national 
                            assembly, whose main task will be to debate and approve 
                            a new constitution. There will also be elections to 
                            18 provincial assemblies as well as to the autonomous 
                            Kurdish parliament in the north.</p>

                            several days around the election, Iraqi borders will 
                            be closed and the nation will be heavily guarded. 
                            The only people allowed to cross the borders are those 
                            who are returning from the hajj, the pilgrimage to 
                            Mecca.</p>
