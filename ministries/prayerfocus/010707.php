<p>
The beginning of a year should be an exciting time for any ministry, and GCC is no exception.  A number of campuses in the area are preparing to take on the challenges and welcome the experiences of a new year, and GCC is likewise taking steps to exhibit God’s love with passion and wisdom.  It is easy to allow past successes to dictate current practices – pray that GCC does not fall into this trap, and that the church would remain prayerful, grounded in the Word, and Spirit-led in 2007.
<p>
<b>Prayer Requests:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>A strong start:</b> As the holiday season winds down and the new year unfolds, pray that GCC’s various ministries start off strong and with renewed energy and focus.  Pray for the servants’ retreat on January 12-13, and pray for every member of the church to experience God’s love powerfully from the beginning.</li>
<li><b>Outreach:</b> Pray that the Bible study groups truly exhibit the notion of ‘family’ in every sense of the word. Pray that the groups actively seek newcomers and that the church continues to have a heart for those who haven’t yet heard the gospel.</li>
<li><b>Unity among the three sites:</b> Pray that each site will remain mindful of the other two throughout the year. Also pray for any logistical issues to be overcome in the name of fellowship and ministry.</li>
</ul>
