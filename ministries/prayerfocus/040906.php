<p>
Every summer, GCC sends out short-term missions teams to different countries to work with local churches in various ministries.  This year, GCC will be partnering with other AMI churches to send teams to Peru and India.  The activities of the missions teams will include evangelism, church planting and encouraging the local believers.  The team to Peru will be leaving from July 7 through August 3, and the India team will go from July 7 to July 21.
<p>
Please pray for wisdom for the leaders (Pastor Seth for India and Pastor Andy for Peru), a cultivated love for the people growing in the hearts of the missions team, fruitful training over the upcoming months, and vision into God’s heart for the people around the world.

<b>Passion Week</b>
<p>
This upcoming week celebrates the Passion of Christ, the week He entered Jerusalem leading up to the day he was crucified.
<p>
During this week, our church will prepare by in fasting.  Some will be taking part in a juice fast, abstaining from any food except juice, and a complete fast on Good Friday to remember Christ’s work on the cross.  We encourage some form of fasting, whether it be the juice fast or abstention from something else, to prepare our hearts for the Passion Week.
