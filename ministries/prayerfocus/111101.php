                          <p align="left">Last 
                            week, on Sunday, November 4th, tens of thousands of 
                            Dalits convened in protest of the centuries of discrimination 
                            they have suffered. The Dalits, also known as the 
                            untouchables, represent the lowest rank within the 
                            Hindu's caste system and society. Although India's 
                            constitution outlaws discrimination on the basis of 
                            caste, the practice continues today in forms of social 
                            and public segregation as Dalits continue to be marginalized 
                            in Indian society.</p>
                          <p align="left">In 
                            protest of the continued exploitation by upper level 
                            caste Hindus, many Dalits have chosen to convert to 
                            other religions, with Sunday's meeting representing 
                            a rallying point against caste discrimination and 
                            proclaiming freedom for Dalits to choose other religions. 
                            Although a majority of the rally's attendees converted 
                            to Buddhism, large numbers of Christian missionaries 
                            were present to len support to the rally and the Gospel 
                            message was presented during the rally. </p>

                                that an openness to convert to other religions 
                                will open the hearts of Dalits to the Gospel message 
                                and enable many to come to a saving relationship 
                                with Jesus Christ<br>

                                were present to hear the message of Jesus' love 
                                and the openness of the Christian community toward 
                                them. Pray that these leaders will share this 
                                message within their communities and among their 
                                people.<br>

                              <li> Pray 
                                that the LORD would continue to solidify the body 
                                of Christ in India so that many will be able to 
                                experience the love of Christ through their witness.<br>

                                religious freedom is protected by law, enforcement 
                                of the law has been poor and Christians in India 
                                have faced increased opposition from the Hindu 
                                government and persecution from Hindu extremists. 
                                Pray that the LORD would strengthen persecuted 
                                brothers and sisters and bring relief from the 
                                oppression.<br>

                              <li> Low 
                                caste Hindus who convert to Christianity lose 
                                their eligibility for affirmative action while 
                                those who become Buddhist do not because Buddhism 
                                is included under the definition of Hindu in the 
                                Constitution. Affirmative action is often necessary 
                                in order for lower caste members to obtain good 
                                jobs. Pray that these Hindus would see the hope 
                                and freesom that comes through the Gospel and 
                                would not be deterred from Christianity on the
