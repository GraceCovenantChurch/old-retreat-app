                      <p><strong>Earthquake in Indonesia - September 09, 2007</strong></p>
<p>A powerful earthquake toppled hundreds of buildings late Wednesday in Indonesia, including nearly 800 homes in the city of Bengkulu alone, and was preceded by a series of aftershocks. 
The damage done by the original quake seems to have been surprisingly low, but at least 10 were killed and another 51 injured. A thorough assessment has yet to be completed, especially in the less accessible regions of Indonesia. Aftershocks alone have shaken many cities along the coast of the Indian Ocean, reportedly trapping many people under collapsed buildings.</p>
<p><b>Prayer Requests:</b>
<ul>
 <li>Please pray for the lives of those suffering this natural disaster, as well as the comfort and protection of their families. May God's peace extend to Indonesia, and may His will be done and His Name uplifted in the entire region.</li>
</ul>
