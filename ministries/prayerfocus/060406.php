<p>
The Remnant Presbyterian Church (TRPC) is located in New York City.  Led by Pastor Victor Kim, TRPC seeks to fulfill the Great Commission to make disciples of all nations. They want specifically to impact the campuses, the communities, and the world for Christ. TRPC seeks to fulfill this mission by challenging people to make a radical commitment to the local church that God chooses to use. Their aim is to produce kingdom workers who are faithful, available, teachable, and sacrificial by valuing worship, growth, accountability, and participation.
<p>
<b>Please pray for:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>The growth of the various ministries at the church.</b> Please pray for the ministries that reach out to new believers and edify members in the church for greater fruit and a worshipful harvest.  Pray that their efforts to reach the community and build the body of Christ would find blessing.  TRPC’s ministries include children’s outreach, campus ministry, community outreach, and inner healing.</li>
<li><b>The leadership of the church.</b>  Pray that Pastor Victor would continue to be anointed in his vision for the church and that the staff would have open hearts listening to the Spirit of God.</li>
<li><b>The greater glory of God through the TRPC as a fellow church in AMI.</b>  The AMI community of churches provides context within which to pray for our brothers and sisters all around the world with a unified spirit for a joint vision.  Pray that TRPC would be used to fulfill God’s glorious plan within its position for the vision of AMI.</li>
