                          <br>
                          Iran was one of the first countries to be occupied by 
                          the early Islamic armies which burst out from Arabia 
                          in the seventh century. Persia, as it was, had been 
                          one of the greatest empires of the ancient world, and 
                          has long maintained a distinct cultural identity within 
                          the Islamic world by retaining its own language and 
                          adhering to the Shi'i interpretation of Islam.<br>
                          <br>
                          In 1979 the country became the centre of world attention 
                          when the monarchy was overthrown and a unique Islamic 
                          republic was declared, in which religious clerics - 
                          headed by Ayatollah Khomeini - wielded ultimate political 
                          control. There followed an unstable and bloody period, 
                          including an eight-year war against Iraq, in which the 
                          country's oil wealth plummeted from its previous high 
                          levels. <br>

                            <li><strong>Reform: 
                              </strong>Two decades later, Iran is entering another 
                              era of political and social transformation. The 
                              victory of the liberals over the long-ruling conservative 
                              elite in parliamentary elections in April 2000 has 
                              signaled a sea-change. <br>
                              <br>
                              </li>
                            <li><strong>Government 
                              Leadership:</strong> President Mohammad Khatami's 
                              support for greater social and political freedoms 
                              has made him popular with the young - an important 
                              factor in electoral terms as over 50% of the population 
                              is under the age of 25. His liberal ideas have, 
                              however, put him at odds with Iran's supreme leader, 
                              Ayatollah Khamene'i, and hard-liners reluctant to 
                              lose sight of established Islamic traditions. </li>
