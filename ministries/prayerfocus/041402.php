                        <p align="left">In 
                          recent months, the conflict between Israel and Palestine 
                          has escalated. Sixteen terrorist attacks have killed 
                          an estimated 33 people as well as injuring many others. 
                          The most recent attack occurred in the Israeli city 
                          of Haifa when a suicide bomber detonated a bomb killing 
                          eight people in a bus and injuring dozens of others. 
                          </p>
                        <p align="left">In 
                          retaliation to the terrorist attacks, the Israeli government 
                          militarily seized several cities in Palestine territory 
                          (Haifa, Jenin, Nablus,Tulkarm, Qalqilya, Ramallah, Jerusalem). 
                          The military campaign by Israel has killed an estimate 
                          of one hundred Palestinians. All negotiations between 
                          Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Palestinian 
                          leader Yasser Arafat have ceased as the terrorist bombings 
                          and Israeli military offensive continue. </p>

                              US Secretary of State Colin Powell is in Israel 
                              to talk with Sharon and Arafat and bring an end 
                              to the violent turmoil. <br>

                              and Palestinian leaders would come to an agreement

                              </strong>The recent violence has caused much harm 
                              to both the Israelites and Palestinians. Many Israelites 
                              worry for their safety while Palestinians are caught 
                              in the midst of Israel's military campaign in the 
                              West Bank. Please pray for the safety of these people 
                              and for a cease fire, that more lives might not 
                              be lost. <br>

                              for Christian workers and missionaries in these 
                              areas as Muslim and Jewish communities fight for 
                              their survival and beliefs. Pray that Christians 
                              will show the love of Jesus by humbly serving the 
                              people there. Also pray that opportunities to share 
                              the Gospel will arise, as true peace will be found 
                              only through Jesus. </li>
