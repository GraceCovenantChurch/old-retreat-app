                          <p align="left">Grace 
                            Covenant Church has been financially and through prayer 
                            supporting Pastor Willar and his church in the village 
                            of Yarina Cocha, located outside of Pulculpa in a 
                            jungle region of Peru, for the past four years. The 
                            church is made up of around 300 people. They are active 
                            in reaching many villages throughout the jungle, and 
                            have a vision of planting many more churches. The 
                            only thing holding them back right now is trained 
                            workers and financial resources. </p>
                          <p align="left">God 
                            is really doing something amazing, especially among 
                            the youth and young adults in the church. They are 
                            the hope for the future. Also, there have been some 
                            leadership problems within the church, and Pastor 
                            Willar needs wisdom in resolving those issues. The 
                            church sent out a nine-member team to La Victoria 
                            in the jungle for a five week short term missions 
                            trip in the beginning of October. The church in La 
                            Victoria is a church plant of Pastor Willar's, and 
                            they are trying to train the leaders there.</p>
