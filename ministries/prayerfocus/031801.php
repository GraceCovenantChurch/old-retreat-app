                        <p>It 
                          is this church&#8217;s desire to be a part of God&#8217;s 
                          plan as He builds His kingdom. A very large aspect of 
                          this is foreign and domestic missions, therefore as 
                          a body, we would like to support some of our brothers 
                          and sisters who partner with us in building God&#8217;s 
                          kingdom. Listed below are the people that our church 
                          supports financially; it is the conviction of this church 
                          that 35% of our offering goes to foreign and domestic 
                          missions.</p>
