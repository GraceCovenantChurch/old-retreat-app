                          Children at War - September 18, 2005</strong></p>
                        <p>Uganda, 
                          a nation in eastern Africa, has a history of civil conflict. 
                          Under several regimes between 1971 and 1985, guerilla 
                          warfare and human rights abuses claimed at least 400,000 
                          lives. Much of the nation and its economy has now stabilized 
                          (although 35% of the country still lives under the poverty 
                          line), but one conflict that the nation faces today 
                          in northern regions is the abduction of children to 
                          be recruited to a rebel militia, the &#8220;Lord&#8217;s 
                          Resistance Army&#8221; (LRA). The LRA was founded in 
                          1987 to overthrow the government and primarily populates 
                          its forces with young children to be used as soldiers, 
                          laborers, and sexual slaves. More than 20,000 children 
                          have been kidnapped by the LRA.</p>
                        <p>Please 
                          pray for:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>The 
                            immediate intervention for the children of northern 
                            Uganda. Pray that the government of Uganda and external 
                            non-government organizations can successfully protect 
                            the children from abduction.<br>
                            <br>
                            </li>
                          <li> 
                            Healing in the face of this humanitarian disaster. 
                            Disarmament, demobilization and reintegration efforts 
                            are largely absent. <br>
                            Spiritual fruit in the midst of disaster. Pray that 
                            the gospel of hope would reach many children to bring 
                            them life-transforming salvation and joy.<br>
