                        <p align="left">The 
                          island nation of Haiti has been subject to severe internal 
                          unrest. Political factions, drug traffickers, and other 
                          powerful influences dictate the government&#8217;s operation. 
                          Human rights violations are rampant; violence against 
                          women and kidnappings by the Haitian police force are 
                          commonplace.</p>
                        <p align="left">Currently, 
                          a U.S.-appointed interim government and a United Nations 
                          peacekeeping force struggle to maintain law and order 
                          after a surge of violence in Haiti. It is also a major 
                          center of international drug traffic because of its 
                          pervasive corruption.</p>
                        <p align="left">Haiti 
                          is also the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere. 
                          80% of the population is below the poverty line and 
                          more than two-thirds of their labor force is not regularly 
                          employed. This ongoing poverty is not only a result 
                          of a bad economy: corruption resides at several levels 
                          of power and weather disasters frequently hit the island. 
                          As a result, refugees fleeing from Haiti can be found 
                          in the neighboring Dominican Republic and in several 
                          other nearby countries, including the U.S.<br>
