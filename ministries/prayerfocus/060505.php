                          Focus: Sudan - June 5, 2005</strong></p>
                        <p align="left">Sudan 
                          is the largest and one of the most diverse countries 
                          in Africa, home to deserts, mountain ranges, swamps 
                          and rain forests. It has emerged from a 21-year civil 
                          war between the mainly Muslim north and the Animist 
                          and Christian south which is said to have cost the lives 
                          of 1.5 million people.</p>
                        <p align="left">After 
                          two years of bargaining the government and rebels signed 
                          a comprehensive peace deal in January 2005. The conflict 
                          arises out of a need for autonomy in certain regions 
                          that are rich in natural resources such as oil and arable 
                          land. These are mostly currently controlled by the Muslim 
                          government, which discriminates against Christians living 
                          in the south.</p>
                        <p align="left">Another 
                          round of peace talks are scheduled for June 10 of this 
                          year.<br>

                            refugees: The conflict has displaced thousands of 
                            citizens from their homes and created what is called 
                            one of the greatest humanitarian disasters of this 
                            era. Pray that God would send workers to care for
