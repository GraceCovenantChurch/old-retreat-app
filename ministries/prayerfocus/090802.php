                            Family Groups meet to not only study the Bible, but 
                            also to provide support for one another through Biblical 
                            friendship, encouragement, and accountability. If 
                            you are interested in learning about or getting more 
                            involved with Grace Covenant Church, we invite you 
                            to join a Family Group. Listed below is some general
