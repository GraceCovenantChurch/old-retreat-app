                          and freshmen-sophomore bonding. The retreat is a great

                          head into the summer. It is also a time when college

                          serving the body of Christ in the Philadelphia area. 
                          This year&#8217;s quiet time focus will be on the majesty 
                          and supremacy of Christ and the change that this causes 
                          in people&#8217;s lives.</p>
