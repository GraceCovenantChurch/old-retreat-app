<p>
In 2002, AMI was founded as a network of churches.  Churches in the network include GCC, HMCC (Michigan), The Remnant Presbyterian Church (NY), Remnant Westside (NY), Church of Southland (California), and JCA (Atlanta).  AMI is a community of churches seeking to model the spirituality, vision, and partnership exemplified in the book of Acts.  AMI is committed to developing disciples of Christ within our churches, as well as spreading the gospel message to unreached people through church planting and missions work.  For more information, see www.amichurches.com.

<b>Please pray for:</b>
<ul>
 <li><b>Edification of the network at events such as the AMI East “United” Conference.</b>  Please continue to pray for the conference, that it would bear fruit and that convictions would stir action.  More generally, pray for the relationships established between the churches in the AMI network through future events and joint projects.</li>
 <li><b>Global missions work.</b>  Please pray for vision and strength for the AMI missions projects all around the world.  Involvement reaches nations in Latin America and Asia, including an upcoming training for church planters in Kazakhstan.  Pray that AMI would prove to be strategically advantageous in accomplishing His Kingdom work internationally.</li>
 <li><b>Church planting.</b>  JCA is the first of what is hoped to be many church plants.  Pray that God would continue to use AMI to reach many places in this country and around the world through churches, and that He would raise up passionate workers to do faithful ministry in church planting.</li>

Dozens of people have died from flooding and landslides, some remain reported missing, and overall more than 700,000 people have been affected in some way.  2,200 have been evacuated to 21 emergency shelters, public transportation has frozen, and schools have been closed.  Flood-related diseases, like conjunctivitis, are affecting more than 40,000.</li>
