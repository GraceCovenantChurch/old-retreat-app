                        <p align="left">Anti-Christian 
                          fundamentalists threatened six Gospel For Asia missionaries 
                          and told them to stop preaching about Jesus. Despite 
                          the threats, the missionaries could not ignore God&#8217;s 
                          calling so they kept preaching and discipling young 
                          believers in the area.</p>
                        <p align="left">On 
                          January 26, the fundamentals kept their promise and 
                          beat the missionaries with intent to kill. The missionaries 
                          were saved when onlookers intervened and now are receiving 
                          treatment in a nearby hospital. They said that they 
                          felt honored to be worthy suffering for Christ. Upon 
                          recovery, the missionaries plan to go back to the same 
                          mission station because of their faith in God&#8217;s 
                          purpose for them and for India. <br>
