<p>
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Membership Weekend</span><br /><br />Membership weekend, to be held on March 23-24, is being held to introduce people to GCC’s mission, vision, and values, as well as more fundamental Christian tenets, such as the statement of faith.  It is also being held to familiarize people with the Acts Ministries International network of churches that GCC belongs to.
<p>
After coming to both sessions, the attendees can then choose whether or not to sign our membership covenant.  GCC will have a covenant signing ceremony in front of the congregation on Sunday, April 1 for those who decide to sign.  Dual memberships will be allowed, for those who are already members of home churches.
</p>
<p><b>Prayer Requests:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ownership: </span>Pray that more people would feel a sense of ownership of the church, and that people would learn the history and beliefs of our church and the future plans of GCC and AMI.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Wisdom: </span>Pray for wisdom for Pastor Young and the staff as they prepare for membership weekend.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Community:</span> Pray that many would come and feel like they are truly a part of a community.</li></ul>
