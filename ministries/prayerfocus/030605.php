                          want to know Christ and the power of His resurrection 
                          and the fellowship of sharing in His sufferings, becoming 
                          like Him in His death, and so, somehow, to attain to 
                          the resurrection from the dead.&#8221; <br>
                          --Philippians 3:10</p>

                          inside and outside of the Church, Easter seems to bring 
                          a renewed interest in Spiritual matters. Church attendance 
                          seems to rise as families gather to celebrate. Although 
                          Easter has undergone a certain degree of commercialization 
                          in our society, we in the Church understand that the 
                          Resurrection of our Lord Jesus from the dead is the 
                          cornerstone of our faith.</p>
                        <p align="left">Because 
                          Jesus is alive, we know that one day we will live forever. 
                          We also know that Christ&#8217;s victory over sin and 
                          death, came only after His sacrifice and crucifixion. 
                          As a body we would like to make this year&#8217;s Easter 
                          Season a time where we can reflect on the Lord&#8217;s 
                          Passion, thank him for His Sacrifice, celebrate in His 
                          Resurrection, and live in His Victory. Listed below 
                          are some events/activities we as a church will observe 
                          in the coming weeks leading up to Easter Sunday.</p>
