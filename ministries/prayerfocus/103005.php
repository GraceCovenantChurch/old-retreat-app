<p>
This past summer, Pastor Paul, Ailsa, and their baby daughter, Caitlyn, departed the U.S. to live in Indonesia as a missionary family.  Pastor Paul and Ailsa were serving at our church faithfully for many years, and last summer, they took the next step in their ministry by responding to God’s call to be missionaries in Indonesia. As a church, we’re excited about the opportunity to support and partner with them as we know that their departure marked a pivotal moment in our church’s history; our vision of "raising up Kingdom workers for the harvest of the world" was taking on a more global and tangible perspective. Currently, they are spending time getting acclimated to their environment by settling into their new home, meeting neighbors and language training.  
<p>
<b>Please pray for:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Their continued adjustment to living in a new country.</b>  Without having mastery of the language, difficulties can arise amidst daily living.  Pray that the family would have keen eyes for culture and adaptive behaviors so that they can connect within their culture at this stage.</li>
<li><b>Health and safety for the family.</b>  Please pray that Pastor Paul and Ailsa would continue to grow together in their marriage and in their vision for the family, and pray that Caitlyn would stay healthy and full of energy.</li>
<li><b>God’s hand of provision and protection in every way: physical, emotional, and spiritual.</b>  Pray that God would cover their lives and be working in their context to keep them near to Him and to accomplish the work that they have been commissioned by Him to do.</li>
</ul>
