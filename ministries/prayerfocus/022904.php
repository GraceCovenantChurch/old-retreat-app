                        <p align="left">The 
                          Passion of the Christ is a movie directed and produced 
                          by Mel Gibson that was released on Ash Wednesday (February 
                          25th). The film takes an incredible look at the last 
                          twelve hours of Jesus&#8217; life. The word Passion 
                          is taken from the Latin word for &#8220;suffering&#8221; 
                          and refers to the agonizing and ultimately redemptive 
                          events of Jesus&#8217; death, starting with Jesus praying 
                          in the garden of Gethsemane and ending with his trial 
                          and execution.</p>

                          Hailed one of the most powerful evangelistic tools of 
                          our generation, this movie has the potential to bring 
                          many to know Jesus and that He died on the cross to 
                          save us from our sins. </p>
