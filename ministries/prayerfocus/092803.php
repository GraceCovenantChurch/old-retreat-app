                          <p align="left">Every 
                            year, our church comes together for a day of friendly 
                            competition known as Mini-Olympics. It is a time where 
                            family groups compete as a team in a variety of events 
                            ranging from simple games, like the egg toss, to the 
                            bizarre, such as the banana derby. The family groups 
                            also spend a lot of time preparing for the event doing 
                            things such as making T-shirts or decorating their 
                            banner. This year, Mini-Olympics will be on Saturday, 
                            October 4th. With this in mind, we would like to ask 
                            the congregation to partner with the church in supporting 
                            this event in prayer. Specifically, we ask that you 
                            pray for&#8230;</p>

                                a wonderful time for the family group to come 
                                together and prepare for a single event. Please 
                                pray that each group would have a God-centered 
                                week of fun and preparation leading up to Saturday.<br>

                                Mini-Olympics is made possible by a staff of referees 
                                that do everything from creating the games to 
                                setting up the field to officiating the events. 
                                Since many of them are busy with work or studies, 
                                please pray that they would experience God&#8217;s 
                                strength and provision as they prepare.<br>

                                forecast! Please pray that God would bless the 
                                entire day, allowing the day to run smoothly. 
                                There are so many aspects, from transportation 
                                to the weather, for which we should ask for God&#8217;s 
                                blessing. Most of all, please pray that the church 
                                would be united in Christ, even through fun events 
                                such as Mini-Olympics.</li>
