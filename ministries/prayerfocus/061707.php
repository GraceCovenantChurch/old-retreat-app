<p>
AMI Revolution is fast approaching and it is in dire need of prayer. This summer GCC has the privilege of hosting AMI Revolution here in Philadelphia.  AMI Revolution is the AMI community's annual summer conference where college students from all of the AMI churches around the country gather together. It's a time for students to worship together and to be mobilized for the glory of God among the nations. College students from across the nation will be gathering here to experience God's glory, discover His will, and to worship with a global mindset.
