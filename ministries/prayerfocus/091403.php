                            with a Harvest Retreat. It all begins with our regular 
                            Friday night service at 7:30 (DRL A1), and afterwards 
                            moves to Springton Lake Presbyterian Church. It will 
                            end a little after dinner Saturday night and rides 
                            will be provided to and from campus. </p>

                            Retreat is a way to start the year off with a right 
                            perspective on the upcoming school year as well as 
                            time to worship with the undergraduate fellowship 
                            as a whole. Like anything our church does, it is also 
                            an event that requires much prayer from start to finish. 
                            We ask that you partner with us in prayer for&#8230;</p>
