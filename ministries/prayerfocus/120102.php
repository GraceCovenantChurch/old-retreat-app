                          <p align="left">In 
                            his first epistle to the people of Thessalonica, Paul 
                            exhorts the Thessalonians to be joyful always, pray 
                            continually, and give thanks in all circumstances. 
                            In light of this instruction, we would like to continue 
                            to thank the LORD for the many ways He has blessed 
                            our church. Through six and a half years of GCC, there 
                            are many ways in which the LORD has shown us unmerited 
                            favor; we know that there will be many more such blessings 
                            in the future. Through them all, may we be a people 
                            marked by thankful hearts.</p>

                                Pastoral Staff:</strong> In a world where the 
                                harvest is so plentiful while the workers are 
                                so few, GCC is blessed with four dedicated pastors. 
                                Let's thank the LORD for Pastor Young and his 
                                family as he continually pours out his life to 
                                serve the LORD by leading this church. Thank the 
                                LORD also for Pastor Paul Chi, Pastor Paul Liu, 
                                and Pastor Matthew Ro who have sacrificed to be 
                                used by the LORD.<br>

                                Service: </strong>This 
                                year, God has opened the door for us to meet more 
                                needs within the young adult and married couples 
                                circle by allowing us to start the Ardmore service. 
                                Take some time to thank the LORD for the Ardmore 
                                service. Also thank the LORD for the ways He has 
                                made this church grow over the last six and a 
                                half years.<br>

                                Groups:</strong> Hopefully many of us can say 
                                we have found friends who stick &quot;closer that 
                                a brother (or sister)&quot; within our family 
                                group; hopefully many of us can say we have found 
                                people who really inspired and challenged us to 
                                live for God within our family groups; and hopefully 
                                many of us can say we have found people just hang 
                                out with on a Saturday night within our family 
                                groups. Whatever the case, let's take some time 
                                to thank the LORD for our family groups, especially 
                                for the brothers and sisters God has placed in 
                                our lives. Also give thanks for the family group 
                                servants, co-servants, and helpers.<br>

                                Teams:</strong> 
                                Whether it be making flyers, selling books, providing 
                                rides, or handing out snacks, our ministry teams 
                                have been faithful in doing much of the behind 
                                the scenes work at this church. Lets take some 
                                time to thank the LORD for the people who serve 
                                Him and us in this capacity.<br>
                                <br>

                                As a church we have learned to take nothing for 
                                granted. Whether it be finding places to worship, 
                                driving church vans, using sound equipment, etc. 
                                the LORD has proven to be a faithful provider. 
                                Take some time and thank the LORD for anything 
                                and everything you can think of that was not listed
