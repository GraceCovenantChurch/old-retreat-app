                            the death of Yasser Arafat, the Palestinians have 
                            recently voted for a new Prime Minister named Mahmoud 
                            Abbas. Along with the change of power comes a new 
                            hope for peace in this region, which has been wrought 
                            with war and terror for nearly half a century.</p>
                          <p align="left"> 
                            Everyday is a struggle for those who reside in and 
                            around the Gaza Strip and West Bank due to militant 
                            groups and constant violence. However, there has been 
                            a recent improvement in relations between the two 
                            nations as officials from each party meet to negotiate 
                            a truce, and hopefully, a lasting peace.</p>
