                        <p align="left"> Algeria, 
                          a gateway between Africa and Europe, has been battered 
                          by violence over the past half-century and remains at 
                          war with itself. More than a million Algerians were 
                          killed in the fight for independence from France in 
                          1962 and an estimated 100,000 have died in the current 
                          power struggle.<br>

                          large country, over four-fifths of its territory is 
                          covered by the Sahara desert. Oil and gas reserves were 
                          discovered here in the 1950s, but the main population 
                          centers remain on the northern coast. Algeria was originally 
                          inhabited by Berbers until the Arabs conquered North 
                          Africa in the 7th century. Staying mainly in the mountainous 
                          regions, the Berbers resisted the spreading Arab influence, 
                          managing to preserve much of their language and culture 
                          until the present day. They make up some 30% of the 
                          total population. </p>

                          Spanish and Turkish rule, in 1830 Algeria was conquered 
                          by the French, who gave it the status of a department 
                          in its own right. The struggle for independence began 
                          in 1954 headed by the National Liberation Front, which 
                          came to power on independence in 1962. </p>

                            have been dominated by the struggle involving the 
                            military and Islamist militants. In that year a general 
                            election won by an Islamist party was annulled, marking 
                            the beginning of a bloody campaign which has seen 
                            the slaughter of tens of thousands of people.<br>

                            of the Berber language, after months of unrest involving 
                            Berber youths pressing for greater cultural and political
