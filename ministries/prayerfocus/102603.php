                            - October 26, 2003</strong></p>
                          <p align="left"> 
                            In 2003, Ramadan begins on October 26 and ends November 
                            24. During this month, healthy Muslim adults observe 
                            Fasting during the daylight hours. Muslim Fasting 
                            is a total abstention from eating, drinking, and sexual 
                            relations from dawn to dusk for 29 or 30 days of the 
                            month of Ramadan. </p>
                          <p align="left">The 
                            purpose of the fasting is to develop God-consciousness, 
                            self-control, improvement of health by reducing or 
                            eliminating impurities from the body, and to become 
                            aware of the plight of the poor, hungry, and the sick. 
                            It is an obligation on every adult and healthy Muslim 
                            to fast during the month of Ramadan. </p>
                          <p align="left">The 
                            month of Ramadan is also the month in which the Holy 
                            Quran was revealed to Prophet Muhammad in piecemeal 
                            basis over a period of 23 years. Ramadan is a month 
                            of spiritual consciousness and high sense of social 
                            responsibility.</p>

                            a Muslim may observe each of these pillars, there 
                            is still no guarantee of salvation. Islam is a religion 
                            based on self-righteousness. Some Muslims believe 
                            that each person&#8217;s deeds are written in a book. 
                            On the fearful Day of Judgment, Allah will open the 
                            books and will weigh each one&#8217;s deeds on a balance 
                            to determine eternity in heaven or hell. Each person 
                            hopes that his good deeds will outweigh his bad deeds. 
                            However, Allah reserves the absolute right to send 
                            individuals to whichever He pleases, hell or paradise.</p>

                                heard enough of the real Gospel to be saved. Ask 
                                God to raise up an abundance of ministries to 
                                proclaim Christ in a culturally sensitive manner.<br>
