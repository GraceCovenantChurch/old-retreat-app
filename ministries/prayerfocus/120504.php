                            World Aids Day - December 05, 2004 </strong></p>
                          <p align="left">December 
                            1st was World Aids Day. HIV/AIDS is one of the biggest 
                            social, economic and health challenges in the world. 
                            It is a global emergency claiming over 8,000 lives 
                            every day. In fact 5 people die of AIDS every minute. 
                            A person infected with HIV does not have AIDS until 
                            the virus seriously damages their immune system, making 
                            them vulnerable to a range of infections, some of 
                            which can lead to death. </p>
                          <p align="left">In 
                            2003, almost 5 million people acquired HIV, which 
                            means there are now almost 38 million people living 
                            with HIV and AIDS. Despite best efforts from governments, 
                            non-profit organizations and healthcare practitioners 
                            around the world, HIV and AIDS is still having huge 
                            global impact. </p>
                          <p align="left">Recently, 
                            HIV/AIDS has been rampant in Africa and Southeast 
                            Asia, especially China. In 2003, 3 million people 
                            were newly infected with HIV. In Asia, the figure 
                            was 1.1 million. </p>

                              of AIDS. In places like Uganda, government efforts 
                              to curb sexual promiscuity and certain cultural 
                              practices have succeeded in the fight against AIDS.
