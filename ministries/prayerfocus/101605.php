                        <p>
The Passion Conference is a time for our church to gather and spend a weekend in worship, in the Word, and in prayer.  God has used past Passion conference in GCC to powerfully change lives and even bring people to Christ.  This year’s speaker is Pastor Bruce Yi, from Remnant West in NYC.
<p>
Please pray for:
<ul>
<li><b>A time of restoration, repentance, refreshing, and renewal in the hearts of the people of GCC</b>.  Pray that through the sermons, worship sessions, or prayer times, hearts would be rejuvenated.  Pray that the blessings would not be only emotional, but of deep and real spiritual value.</li>
<li><b>The speaker, Pastor Bruce Yi, the worship team, and GCC staff</b>.  Pray for these people who will be leading us in the worship times with truth in the Word, depth in worship, and genuine fruit in prayer.</li>
<li><b>The logistics of holding a conference over three days</b>.  Pray for the locations, the equipment, the rides and any other logistical concerns.  Pray that everything would run smoothly, without distraction, for the maximum glory of God.</li>
<li><b>Pray for the weeks following Passion</b>.  Please pray that good fruit would be borne in the actual lives and hearts of people, that GCC would live out the blessings received at Passion in a real and challenging way.  Pray against any stumbling blocks that might rob blessings in the time immediately following the conference.</li>
                        </ul>
