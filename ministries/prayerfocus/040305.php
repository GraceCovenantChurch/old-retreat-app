                          Monday, Indonesia suffered an earthquake that measured 
                          8.7 on the Richter scale and it is estimated that 1,000 
                          people have died. The nation was still recovering from 
                          the effects of the Christmas Tsunami, which happened 
                          on December 26, 2004. The earthquake affected most of 
                          the Indonesians islands, especially one called Nias.</p>
