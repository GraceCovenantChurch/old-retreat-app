                          <p align="left">Recently, 
                            Uganda has been one of Africa&#8217;s success stories. 
                            During the 1970s and 1980s, Uganda was notorious for 
                            its human rights abuses, suffered through civil war, 
                            and economic catastrophe. However, since 1986 when 
                            President Yoweri Museveni introduced democratic reforms, 
                            Uganda has become a model of relative stability, peace, 
                            and even moderate prosperity.</p>
                          <p align="left">However, 
                            he has been unable to control the rebel led insurgencies 
                            in the north and west which have led to the death, 
                            kidnapping, and displacement of tens of thousands 
                            of people. The rebel group, the Lord&#8217;s Resistance 
                            Army, says that it wants to rule Uganda according 
                            to the Biblical Ten Commandments. The movement originated 
                            among the Acholi people when a prostitute named Alice 
                            Lakwena rallied around her those who felt excluded 
                            from power after Yoweri Museveni became president. 
                            </p>
                          <p align="left">The 
                            LRA is currently led by self-proclaimed prophet Joseph 
                            Kony who is infamous for his cruelty. Since its creation, 
                            the LRA has become synonymous with torture, kidnappings, 
                            and destruction. Initially, they were notorious for 
                            their violent opposition to bicycles since they felt 
                            people used them to warn the government troops of 
                            their presence. Riders would be either killed or have 
                            their feet amputated. An estimated 20,000 of children 
                            have been kidnapped by the rebels, mostly taken from 
                            their own homes under the cover of night. </p>
                          <p align="left">The 
                            boys are trained as child soldiers and the girls are 
                            turned into sex slaves. 1.3 million people have been 
                            displaced from their homes. The LRA has managed to 
                            survive repeated government offensives because of 
                            support from the Sudanese army and this was intended 
                            to punish the Ugandan government for supporting the 
                            rebel Sudanese People&#8217;s Liberation Army in southern 
                            Sudan.</p>

                                North and West have criticized both the Ugandan 
                                government and the international circle for the 
                                lack of aid and protection. Please pray for wisdom 
                                in the leadership as they look for ways to bring 
                                this conflict to an end.</li>
