                          This 
                          year&#8217;s Mini-Olympics is long-awaited because of 
                          last year&#8217;s rain out. For those familiar, Mini-Olympics 
                          is a time when family groups get together to have friendly 
                          competitions and fellowship with each other. The games, 
                          medals, and prizes are in the preparation stages as 
                          are family groups, banners, and t-shirts. The event 
                          is a tradition that brings our whole church together 
                          for a memorable day.</p>
