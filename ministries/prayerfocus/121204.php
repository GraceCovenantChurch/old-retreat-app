                            January 5-8, Montrose PA<br>

                          <p>Seventeen 
                            years ago, a group of college students from the East 
                            Coast gathered together with a heart to worship the 
                            Lord and reach the nations. Now the OIL conference 
                            numbers nearly a thousand, with attendees arriving 
                            from coast to coast, from diverse backgrounds and 
                            ranging from undergraduate to graduate students to 
                            young adults in the workplace. </p>
                          <p>This 
                            year's theme, &quot;His Redemption Story,&quot; will 
                            center around history, not found in any textbook, 
                            but as seen through the eyes of God. There are some 
                            people in history who the Lord considers &quot;movers 
                            and shakers&quot; for His kingdom. Though the world 
                            may deem them insignificant, these are the ones our 
                            Commander desires to use as He marches inexorably 
                            forward. Through OIL 2005, may you and I become more 
                            a part of His Redemption Story. </p>
