                          a population of 228 million, Indonesia is the largest 
                          Muslim state in the world. In the midst of trying to 
                          regain political stability since former president Suharto 
                          stepped down in 1998, the country has seen a rise in 
                          activity among Muslim extremist groups in the country.

                          "holy war" against Christians. The army is mostly composed 
                          of veterans from Bosnia and Afghanistan along with students

                          in Sulawesi and the Moluccas islands. In Ambon, Poso 
                          and Tentena, many churches have been attacked and burnt
