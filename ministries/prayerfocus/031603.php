                        <p>Since 
                          the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russia has 
                          been striving to overcome the legacy of Communism. Creating 
                          a democratic political system and a market economy to 
                          replace the bureaucracy and centralism of the past has 
                          proved an elusive goal.</p>
                        <p>The 
                          country impresses with its diversity and size. Spanning 
                          10 time zones, this Eurasian land mass covers over 17m 
                          sq kms. Its climate ranges from the Arctic north to 
                          the generally temperate south.<br>
                          After nearly 10 years of crisis, peaking in August 1998 
                          with the devaluation of the rouble, the Russian economy 
                          bounced back more quickly than many expected. However, 
                          it is heavily dependent on world oil prices.</p>

                            is the main religion, there are many religious groups. 
                            Muslims are concentrated among the Volga Tatars and 
                            the Bashkirs and in the North Caucasus.<br>

                            for Moscow. Many thousands have died since Russian 
                            troops were first sent in to put down a separatist 
                            rebellion in 1994 and guerrilla fighters continue 
                            to mount attacks.<br>

                            between Russia's pursuit of an independent path and 
                            its need to build a new relationship with the USA 
                            and the rest of the world. </li>
