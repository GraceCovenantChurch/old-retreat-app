                        <p align="left">On 
                          March 19th, following a declaration by President Bush, 
                          international forces led by the United States began 
                          a campaign to remove the current Iraqi regime. The declaration 
                          came after months of military inspections and UN deliberations 
                          that resulted in a rift in the international community 
                          and a US determination to rid the world of a possible 
                          threat of attack by weapons of mass destruction. </p>
                        <p align="left">One 
                          of the goals of the campaign is also to rid the Iraqi 
                          people of almost 25 years of dictatorship and to institute 
                          a stable democracy. Now well into the 2nd week of fighting, 
                          Allied soldiers are steadily pushing their way to Baghdad 
                          against a less organized and more poorly equipped Iraqi 
                          force. Counting from the 10th day teh Allied forces 
                          have 57 casualties while Iraq has estimated more than 
                          350 civilian deaths and more than 3,600 injuries.</p>
