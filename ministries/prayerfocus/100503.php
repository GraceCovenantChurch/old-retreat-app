                            from the Peru team, GCC was lucky enough to also be

                            Thailand/Cambodia. The team in Kensington worked with 
                            Pastor Frank Vega at Inner City Missions for one week 
                            ministering to the needs of the people there. </p>

                            English to elementary school children and then traveled 
                            to Cambodia for three weeks, working with various 
                            churches and missions organizations in reaching out

                            While our teams were out on the missions field, they 
                            were able to see first hand God&#8217;s mighty power 
                            and amazing love for His people. During these trips, 
                            God&#8217;s love was especially evident in the lives 
                            of the workers and missionaries that have devoted 
                            their lives to serving God&#8217;s people.</p>

                            of the year, but our prayers can offer them much needed 
                            support year-round. We ask for your partnership as 
                            a church to join these teams in praying for those 
                            whose work begins when the missions teams leave.</p>

                                Frank Vega founded this organization in 1994 to 
                                serve the people of Kensington, Philadelphia. 
                                This part of Philadelphia has long been labeled 
                                the &#8220;badlands&#8221; of Philadelphia and 
                                is plagued by drug abuse, prostitution, high crime, 
                                and high levels of school drop-outs. Pastor Frank, 
                                himself a recovering addict, has now dedicated 
                                his life to saving the &#8220;unreachable&#8221;

                                their trip to Cambodia, the team was able to work 
                                with this organization that works to solve some 
                                of the everyday problems for the poor. For example, 
                                up to 30% of the children in some parts of Cambodia 
                                die due to dehydration from diarrhea. <br>

                                RDI then worked to provide clean water for these 
                                rural areas. This type of ministry is invaluable 
                                in a country that forbids public evangelism. Please 
                                also that Christians in Cambodia will stand firm 
                                in the face of discrimination and persecution 
                                in a primarily Buddhist nation.<br>

                                in Thailand is extremely small and lately they 
                                have been battling hard against booming sex industry 
                                in Thailand. This country has the highest rates 
                                of HIV infection in Asia and leaving an estimated 
                                80.000 orphans. This problem has even united the 
                                Church with it&#8217;s previously perceived enemies, 
                                the Buddhist majority, in fighting to stem the 
                                epidemic. </li>
