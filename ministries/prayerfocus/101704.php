                        <p>Population: 14.1 million (UN, 2003) 
                          <br>
                          Capital: Phnom Penh <br>
                          Area: 181,035 sq km (69,898 sq mi) <br>
                          Major language: Khmer <br>
                          Major religion: Buddhism</p>
                        <p>On Thursday, a new king was elected 
                          in Cambodia by its Throne Council after his father, 
                          King Sihanouk abdicated due to illness. King Sihamoni, 
                          the successor, will be coronated later this month. </p>
                        <p>Cambodia is one of the world&#8217;s 
                          poorest nations. Most of the people are subsistence 
                          farmers although tourism is becoming a more prominent 
                          aspect of the economy. Cambodia is threatened by the 
                          spreading AIDS epidemic, which is already rampant in 
                          China and other parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p><strong>Prayer requests for Cambodia:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                          <li><strong>Spiritual warfare:</strong> 
                            Our missions teams recently came back from a trip 
                            from Cambodia. Pray that the seeds they and other 
                            missionaries have sown will reap bountiful harvest 
                            and that many Cambodians will come to Christ. <br>
                            <br>
                            </li>
                          <li><strong>Leadership: </strong>Pray 
                            that the new leader, although primarily a figurehead, 
                            will be inspired to serve the nation so that its people 
                            will be able to learn about Jesus.<br>
