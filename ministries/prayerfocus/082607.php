                      <p><strong>A New Ministry Year - August 26, 2007</strong></p>
<p>
The beginning of a ministry year should be an exciting time for any ministry, and GCC is no exception.  A number of campuses in the area are preparing to take on the challenges and welcome the experiences of a new year, and GCC is likewise taking steps to exhibit God's love with passion, energy, and focus.  It is easy to allow past successes to dictate current practices - pray that GCC does not fall into this trap, and that the church would remain prayerful, grounded in the Word, and Spirit-led.</p>
<p><b>Prayer Requests:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Family groups:</b>  Pray that the Bible study groups truly exhibit the notion of 'family' in every sense of the word.</li>
<li><b>Welcoming/outreach:</b> Pray that the church continues to have a heart for those who haven't yet heard the gospel.</li>
<li><b>Campus Intro Nights:</b>  As the event that marks many people's first experience with GCC, a Campus Intro Night should be welcoming, informative, fun, and Christ-centered.   Pray for the planners of the event as well as those who will be attending.</li>
</ul>
