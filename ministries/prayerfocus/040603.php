                          &#8220;For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
                          that though he was rich yet for your sake he became 
                          poor so that you through his poverty might become rich.&#8221;

                        <p align="left">Many 
                          of the children of Kensington live in desperate conditions, 
                          where Jesus becomes the only answer to their situations. 
                          Many come from broken homes, live in drug infested and 
                          crime ridden neighborhoods and do not experience love. 
                          Many have experienced physical, sexual and emotional 
                          abuse arising from poverty and neglect. </p>
                        <p align="left">Jesus 
                          Christ left his throne in Heaven to come down in human 
                          form to bring hope to all souls languishing in spiritual 
                          poverty. In the midst of such darkness and hopelessness, 
                          the Gospel brings light and hope. Jesus Christ is the 
                          lover of our souls and will restore the children of 
                          Kensington to a relationship with their Father in Heaven.

                              Kensington Community:</strong> The power of the 
                              Gospel can break the bonds of darkness of moral 
                              sin, poverty and crime. Pray that God will do a 
                              special work in the lives of the children who grow 
                              up in such hard circumstances<br>

                              the Workers:</strong> Pastor Frank Vega is director 
                              of Philadelphia Inner City Missions. Pray for his 
                              health and for wisdom in the midst of spiritual 
                              battle and for supernatural strength to persevere. 
                              Pray also for the workers God has called from our 
                              church and elsewhere who minister in Kensington 
                              year-round.<br>

                              Pastor Frank Vega from May 31-June 7. Please pray 
                              for God to provide and empower the team. Pray that 
                              God will also fill their hearts with God&#8217;s 
                              sacrificial love for the children of Kensington.</li>
