                        <p align="left">In 
                          1979 the country became the centre of world attention 
                          when its monarchy was overthrown and a unique Islamic 
                          republic was declared. This meant that religious clerics 
                          - headed by Ayatollah Khomeini - wielded ultimate political 
                          control. There followed an unstable and bloody period, 
                          including an eight-year war with Iraq, in which the 
                          country's oil wealth plummeted from its previous high 
                          levels.</p>
                        <p align="left">Presently, 
                          the US has recognized Iran as a possible nuclear power 
                          and as such, a destabilizing force in world security. 
                          The US and other powers are trying to dissuade Iran 
                          from further developing a weapons program. While there 
                          are talks going on with European powers in Geneva, relations 
                          between the US and Iran have intensified. This is partially 
                          due to US actions toward Syria and the Iranian decision 
                          to stand by Syria as an ally.<br>

                            for Christian influence in Iran as foreign missionaries 
                            were ousted from Iran in the late 1980&#8217;s and 
                            early 1990&#8217;s. There is a lot of pressure from 
                            the Iranian government to oust Christian leaders from 
                            Iran.
