<p>
The various ministry teams of GCC are comprised of brothers and sisters who wish to serve God by serving some of the needs of the church. The teams are an invaluable part of GCC and fulfill many duties that go unnoticed.
Please pray for spiritual protection, growth, and vision for all the teams.
<p>
<b>Prayer Requests:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Growth:</b> Pray that God would call more people to serve in different ways and that the teams would grow in number. Also pray that those who do serve are furthering their own relationships with God and gaining new insights into what it means to serve.</li>
<li><b>Sacrifice:</b> Serving the church is not easy; it is time-consuming and can be extremely challenging. Pray that God would teach us how to sacrifice properly and imitate Christ more by putting others’ needs before our own.</li>
<li><b>Leadership:</b> Pray that the leaders of the ministry teams would continue to be empowered by the Spirit.</li>
</ul>
