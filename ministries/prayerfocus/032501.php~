                        <p align="left">This 
                          past Monday, the Human Rights Center in China reported 
                          that two Christian leaders were detained for preaching 
                          at a home in central China. Last week, Luo Gang and 
                          He Ping, preachers for the underground Chinese Evangelical 
                          Fellowship, were arrested while leading a family prayer 
                          service in the Hubei province. </p>
                        <p align="left">The 
                          Chinese Evangelical Fellowship has been branded by Beijing 
                          as one of a dozen existing &quot;evil cults&quot; in 
                          the country, yet various leaders of the fellowship continuously 
                          express their love for China and its people. The Chinese 
                          Evangelical Fellowship is known for their desire for 
                          consolidation and for the freedom to share the Gospel 
                          of Jesus Christ. In light of this week's incident, let 
                          us lift up our brothers Luo Gang and He Ping as well 
                          as the country of China in our prayers.</p>

                              this past summer, God opened the door for us to 
                              send to of our sisters into the country of China 
                              teaching English. In light of this past week’s occurrence, 
                              let us continue to lift up the various concerns 
                              of China in our prayers. <br>

                              is reported by Amnesty International in China that 
                              several leaders of the Chinese Evangelical Fellowship 
                              are currently detained in labor camps throughout 
                              China, some since 1998. Please remember to keep 
                              them in your prayers as they faithfully serve the 
                              Lord even within the camps. Please pray for the 
                              house church movement in China. <br>

                            <li> Pray 
                              that the leaders of this movement would be committed 
                              to preach the gospel whatever the cost and without 
                              compromise. Pray that the gospel would move especially 
                              in the hearts of the members of the Communist Party. 
                              Pray that the Holy Spirit would continue to convict 
                              their hearts of their sin and their need. Pray also 
                              for those members of the Communist Party that are 
                              “secret believers.” <br>
