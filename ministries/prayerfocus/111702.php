                          <p align="left">Although 
                            China has a growing population of over 1.2 billion 
                            people, one fifth of the world's population, the number 
                            of Christians in China barely reaches 6%. This number 
                            is greatly contributed by the Communist reign which 
                            began in 1949. In the 1960s, the government attempted 
                            to eliminate organized religion. As a result pastors 
                            were imprisoned, Christians were persecuted, and church 
                            buildings were closed down - thus driving churches 
                            underground.</p>
                          <p align="left">The 
                            Christian Church has gone though much suffering, but 
                            in the late 1970s there was a breakthrough. Churches 
                            were permitted to re-open under the control of the 
                            Three Self Patriotic Movement. This movement allows 
                            people to worship and to minister legally, but there 
                            are still many restrictions. The main restrictions 
                            include that churches must register with the government 
                            and that Christian activities may only take place 
                            in registered buildings or homes, led by an official 
                            pastor. The greatest growth in the church has occurred 
                            in the past twenty years. Praise God!</p>

                                Christians:</strong> Many Christian refuse to 
                                associate themselves with the Three Self Patriotic 
                                Movement, seeing it as serving the government 
                                first, rather than God. They choose to meet in 
                                house churches instead, but face much persecution 
                                if discovered by government officials. Please 
                                pray for much strength and wisdom as these brothers 
                                and sisters seek to worship God freely.<br>

                                </strong>The 
                                government has a tight reign over all aspects 
                                of the people of China. Please pray that the government 
                                officials would have soft hearts towards the people 
                                and that the Gospel would reach many. Also pray 
                                for a peaceful and stable government.<br>
                                <br>

                              <li> <strong>Growth:</strong> 
                                As many young people see the temptation and appeal 
                                of the secular world, many congregations are aging. 
                                In addition, it is illegal to share the Gospel 
                                with anyone under 18. Therefore there are virtually 
                                no youth groups. Please pray that young people 
                                would hear the call from God and take action.<br>

                                </strong>Please pray that the Good News of salvation 
                                will spread throughout China. There are many rural 
                                parts and ethinic minorities that have never heard 
                                the Gospel of Jesus.<br>

                                Pray for the missionaries in China, that they 
                                would have renewed hearts and much joy as they 
                                devote their lives to His Kingdom work.</li>
