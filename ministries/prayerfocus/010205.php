                            Sunday, December 26, 2004, a massive earthquake that 
                            measured 9.0 on the Richter scale struck just off 
                            the coast of Aceh, Indonesia, sending tidal waves 
                            of more than 10m to the Southeast Asian region.</p>
                          <p align="left">The 
                            death toll is rising everyday; the hardest hit countries 
                            are Indonesia, Sri Lanka and India. In addition to 
                            the damage done to their homes, land and livelihoods, 
                            the survivors now suffer threats of insect-borne diseases 
                            that come from lack of sanitation and food.</p>

                              government institutions have collapsed and there

                            would have the wisdom as to how to allocate funds
