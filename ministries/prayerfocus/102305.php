                        <p>
More than 48,000 (some sources report up to 79,000) are dead and more than 3 million are left homeless after a terrible earthquake hit Asia two weeks ago.  The quake hit a region in Pakistan and India, near the hotly disputed Kashmir area.
<p>
Pakistan is scrambling to amass resources for treatment and desperately need international aid.  UNICEF stated that it has yet to reach an estimated 120,000 children in Pakistan’s mountainous region in the north and more than 10,000 of them could die from hunger, hypothermia or disease in coming weeks.  U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan stated that the amount of aid pledged to this disaster covers only about 10% of the need.
<p>
<b>Please pray for:</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Swift, efficient and effective aid</b>.  Even this minute, people are starving and homeless in the Himalayas.  Please pray that aid would find people in a timely way, that not one life would be lost because aid didn’t reach them in time.  Pray also that people worldwide would continue to be generous givers in this life-or-death time of need.</li>
<li><b>God’s glory in the midst of strife</b>.  Pray that in some way, God’s grace would overflow in destroyed lives and torn homes.  "But you, O God, do see trouble and grief; you consider it to take it in hand.  The victim commits himself to you; you are the helper of the fatherless."  Psalm 10:14 (NIV).</li>
</ul>
