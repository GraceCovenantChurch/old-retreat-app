                          <p align="left">Operation 
                            Christmas Child sends a message to hope to children 
                            in desperate situations around the world through gift 
                            filled shoe boxes and Christian literature. This program 
                            provides an opportunity for individuals of all ages 
                            to be involved in a simple, hands on missions project 
                            that reaches out to suffering children while focusing 
                            on the true meaning of Christmas - Jesus Christ, God's 
                            greatest gift. In 2001, the project led to the collection 
                            over 5 million shoeboxes worldwide and they distributed 
                            the shoeboxes to over 95 countries.</p>
                          <p align="left">One 
                            example of how this has touched hearts is the following. 
                            At the distribution in Dasht-i-Qala in Afghanistan, 
                            the provincial governor explained that some of the 
                            gifts had come from New York children - children who 
                            had also suffered at the hands of terrorists and extremists. 
                            Even more important fo rhis Muslim audience, he acknowledged 
                            that the gifts came from Christians who wanted to 
                            share God's love: &quot;These gifts are from Christian 
                            children in the West,&quot; he said. &quot;They want 
                            to know that God has not forgotten you.&quot;</p>
                          <p align="left">Operation 
                            Christmas Child has sent 120,000 shoe box gifts to 
                            sites across Afghanistan, part of a distribution of 
                            nearly 300,000 to Central Asia. These gifts help our 
                            local ministry partners build relationships with families 
                            and community leaders, opening doors that can lead 
                            to more freedom to chare the Good News of Jesus Christ.</p>
