                        <p align="left">This 
                          Friday and Saturday (June 14 and 15), our church will 
                          be participating in the 2002 Summer Retreat. The Summer 
                          Retreat provides an excellent opportunity for the members 
                          of our congregation to reflect on the past ministry 
                          year and to rededicate the remainder of the summer to 
                          loving and serving Jesus. </p>
                        <p align="left">It 
                          is our desire that this summer would be a season of 
                          prayer and meditation on the Word of the people of this 
                          church. As a body, we would like to cover over this 
                          summer&#8217;s retreat, so that the Lord would meet 
                          and touch every single person who comes.</p>
                        <p align="left">This 
                          year&#8217;s retreat will be held on <strong>June 14 
                          and 15</strong> at the Springton Lake Presbyterian Church 
                          located in Newton Square, PA. The Lord has blessed us 
                          with three speakers this year. Reverend <strong>Sam 
                          Lee</strong> of Harvest International Church in Rutgers, 
                          NJ will speak during the Friday evening service and 
                          for the Sunday Worship Service. Reverend <strong>Paul 
                          Kim</strong> and Pastor <strong>Steve Kim</strong> of 
                          the Emmanuel Church in Philadelphia will deliver the 
                          Word of God during the Saturday morning and evening 
                          services, respectively.</p>

                              guest speakers as they boldly proclaim God&#8217;s 
                              Word and would be able to discern our individual 
                              and congregational needs.<br>

                              Pray that our times of corporate worship would be 
                              a pleasing and acceptable the Lord. Pray that we 
                              as a people would be able to feel the presence of 
                              the Lord as we worship. Pray for Pastor Paul Liu

                              as a church, we want to make this summer a season 
                              of prayer both individually and corporately. Pray 
                              that the Holy Spirit would teach us how to pray, 
                              and that these times of prayer would strengthen 
                              our individual prayer lives.<br>
