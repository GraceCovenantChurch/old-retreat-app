<p>
Pastor Milo Cho, his wife Natalie, and their three children Abigail, Deborah, and Stephen have been in Bangkok, Thailand since August 2005.  Serving through Pioneers, Pastor Milo has been focusing on the college and young adult ministry in the heavily Buddhist country.
<p>
<b>Prayer Requests:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Spreading of the Gospel:</b> Thailand’s population is over 90 percent Buddhist.  Please pray that the Gospel may be spread and accepted, and that the existing churches may be able to network together to provide a stronger foundation for believers.</li>
<li><b>Logistics:</b> Pastor Milo’s visa has to be renewed every three months.  Please pray for God’s provision in this area.</li>
<li><b>Children’s protection and growth:</b> Please pray for the continued spiritual protection of Abigail, Deborah, and Stephen, and for the smooth adoption of Thai culture.</li>
<li><b>Political stability:</b> Thailand is poised to hold elections in October 2007, its first since becoming a constitutional monarchy in 1932.  Pray that the country transitions smoothly to new leadership and that a more open government might allow for opportunities to spread the Gospel.</li>
