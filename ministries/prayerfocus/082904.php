                            discipleship of Christians:</strong> In the past year, 
                            the Temple ministry has started from very few numbers 
                            but has grown tremendously. Pray that God would continue 
                            to nurture the Christians there through prayer, the 
                            Word, and through campus outreach. <br>

                          <li><strong>Campus 
                            outreach:</strong> Temple has huge potential to bring 
                            non-believers to Christ because of its considerable 
                            size. Pray that the Christians there would strive 
                            to make an impact for the kingdom of God and that 
                            students there would be ready to hear the Gospel.

                        <p><strong>Emmaus 
                          Family Group Ministry</strong></p>
                        <p>At 
                          GCC we place a high emphasis on Family Groups because 
                          we believe that it is in these smaller groups that we 
                          are able to meet with God, build meaningful relationships, 
                          and develop biblical accountability. Through Bible study, 
                          sharing, prayer, and fellowship we learn to live out 
                          the teachings of the Bible in our daily lives with the 
                          ultimate goal of each member to be transformed into 
                          the image of Jesus Christ.</p>
                        <p>As 
                          we enter our ninth year of ministry, we are excited 
                          to see what God will do at GCC. Beginning this September 
                          2004, the Emmaus (young adult/post-college) Fellowship 
                          will have various co-ed groups that will meet throughout 
                          the week either in the city or in the suburbs of Philadelphia. 
                          There will also be family groups specifically for graduate 
                          students and married couples. Please pray for the Emmaus 
                          Family Group Ministry, join a family group, and be a 
                          part of building a biblical community at GCC.</p>
                        <p>&#8220;Let 
                          us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for He 
                          who promised is faithful. And let us consider how we 
                          may spur one another on toward love and good deeds. 
                          Let us not give up meeting together, as some are in 
                          the habit of doing, but let us encourage one another--and 
                          all the more as you see the Day approaching.&#8221;
