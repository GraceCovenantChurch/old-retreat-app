                          system. The almost simultaneous attacks struck 3 subways 
                          and a bus during the morning&#8217;s rush hour.</p>

                          investigations into the bombings ensue, families of

                          police hotline has received more than 100,000 calls 
                          regarding information about casualties.<br>
