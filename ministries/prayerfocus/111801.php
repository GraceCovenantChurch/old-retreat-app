                          <p align="left">Turkey 
                            is one of the most unreached nations in the world. 
                            With a population of almost 67 million, Turkey is 
                            99.8% Muslim and only 0.2% Christian or Jewish. Although 
                            Turkey has a secular government that professes freedom 
                            of belief and worship, the Turksih government is active 
                            in arresting and deporting foreign Christians. Due 
                            to Turkey's positive attitude toward Americans, however, 
                            God has opened doors of peaceful relations between 
                            Turks and Americans. This allows Americans to remain, 
                            presenting the opportunity to share the Gospel through 
                            Christian witness.<br>

                            Grace Covenant Church supports Dan, a full time missionary 
                            to Turkey. Dan has been focusing mainly in the northeastern 
                            region of Turkey, near the Black Sea Where among an 
                            area population of about 12 million, there are only 
                            a handful of believers. Recently Dan, along with other 
                            missionaries currently living in Turkey, met with 
                            a few Turkish believers and foreign workers in the 
                            area to pray, share and strategize about ways to reach 
                            the people of the Black Sea area. <br>
                            <br>
                            They believe that the most credible and government-approved 
                            means through which the missionaries can share the 
                            Gospel is teaching English. However, the missionaries 
                            that have gathered in Turkey along with Dan face many 
                            potential obstacles as political connections are needed 
                            to work through the many governmental rules and regulations 
                            currently in place.</p>

                                October 7, a new translation of the Turkish Bible 
                                became public and has provided Christians with 
                                the means of sharing the Gospel with more clarity. 
                                Pray for the effective distribution of the new
