                        <p>On 
                          October 6, two pastors in Chhattisgarh (India) were 
                          abducted and released while serving the Lord. The ordeal 
                          began two days ago when pastors Tulsiram and Vijay were 
                          beaten in front of their congregation and dragged away. 
                          Vijay managed to escape, but Tulsiram was kept overnight 
                          and beaten repeatedly. He was told to leave the village 
                          or be killed. Meanwhile, before a gathering of the village 
                          council, new believers shared how the Gospel has changed 
                          their lives. <br>
