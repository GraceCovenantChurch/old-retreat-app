                        <p align="left">Beginning 
                          this Thursday, August 21 until Saturday, August 23, 
                          the Servants Team of our church will be preparing for 
                          the upcoming 2003 - 2004 ministry year by participating 
                          in the 2003 Servant's Retreat. The Servants Team is 
                          made up of the brothers and sisters of our church who 
                          act as the servants (leaders), co-servants, and helpers 
                          within our family groups. </p>
                        <p align="left">This 
                          retreat provides a wonderful opportunity for our Servant's 
                          Team to prepare for the upcoming ministry year through 
                          listening to various seminars/sermons, times of prayer, 
                          worship, etc. It is the prayer of this church that the 
                          LORD would use the upcoming Servant's Retreat to bless 
                          and strengthen the servants of our church so that they 
                          can, in turn, be used to bless and strengthen this congregation.

                          <strong>Listed below are some ways you can pray for 
                          the 2003 Servant's Retreat and your Servant, Co-Servant(s), 
                          and Helper(s). </strong></p>

                              of the Holy Spirit:</strong> Each individual's ministry 
                              is an overflow of God's ministry on the individual. 
                              Our servants cannot give unless they have received 
                              from the LORD, they cannot teach unless they have 
                              learned, and they cannot loved unless Christ's hear 
                              compels them to do so. Pray that the Holy Spirit 
                              would anoint our servants, so they would become 
                              living, breathing instruments of God's love. <br>

                              of Joy, Privilege, Thanksgiving, and Servitude: 
                              </strong>We 
                              are thankful for the innumerable ways that the LORD 
                              has blessed this church during the last five years. 
                              There is no denying that the LORD is the One who 
                              has been building this church. As the servants get 
                              ready for the year, pray that they would always 
                              be overcome by a sense of thanksgiving that the 
                              LORD has allowed them to be a part of what He is 
                              doing here at GCC. It is a privilege to serve, especially 
                              when in truth the LORD does not need people to build 
                              His Kingdom.<br>
                              <br>
                            </li>
                            <li> <strong>Heart 
                              of Love and Humility: </strong>Pray 
                              that each servant would have a greater understanding 
                              of God's love for His people. Pray for humility, 
                              as every servant needs to grow more and more in 
                              the grace and knowledge of our LORD, and also pray 
                              that each servant would have an unquenchable desire 
                              to see the Kingdom of God built in our generation.</li>
