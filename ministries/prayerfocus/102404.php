                        <p>Typhoon 
                          Tokage swept ashore in Japan on Wednesday, striking 
                          its main islands before being downgraded to a tropical 
                          storm later in the evening. By early Thursday, the storm 
                          had headed east into the Pacific Ocean. The current 
                          death toll is at 68, 20 are missing and about 350 are 
                          injured.</p>

                            missionaries in Japan would be encouraged to spread 
                            the Gospel and that Japanese citizens would be ready
