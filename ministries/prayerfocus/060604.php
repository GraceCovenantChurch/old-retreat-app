                          - June 06, 2004</strong></p>
                        <p align="left">This 
                          week&#8217;s announcement of a plan for Iraqi sovereign 
                          government seems to be good news to the ears of political 
                          leaders and the Iraqi people. The Coalition Provisional 
                          Authority is to hand over power by June 30th to provide 
                          for a sovereign interim government. In 2005, elections 
                          are to be held for a fully functional and democratic 
                          Iraqi National Assembly and constitution. </p>
                        <p align="left">This 
                          announcement comes amid many scandals involving the 
                          Iraqi war, including the mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners 
                          and the leaking of secrets by top U.S. officials. </p>
                        <p align="left"><strong>Prayer 
                          requests for Iraq: </strong></p>

                          <ul>
                            <li><strong>The 
                              peace process: </strong>Since 
                              the war has ended, there have been an increased 
                              number of casualties from hostilities. Please pray 
                              that U.S. soldiers would provide security instead 
                              of insecurity in Iraq. <br>

                              <strong>The interim government:</strong> The interim 
                              government is now being appointed to rule Iraq. 
                              Its most important goal is to establish sovereignty 
                              in the international community. It must also effectively 
                              allocate resources among Iraqi citizens in order 
                              to ensure the welfare of the people. Pray that talented 
                              and burdened leaders would use diplomacy to quell 
                              the violence and help the citizens of Iraq. <br>

                            <li><strong>The 
                              United Nations and U.S:</strong> The U.N. Security 
                              Council is expected to approve of the U.S. plan 
                              for Iraqi sovereignty. However, there are concerns 
                              about the use of U.S. troops in Iraq, which have 
                              currently been suffering casualties. Pray that God 
                              would use U.S. troops in Iraq in the best way possible.

                              <strong>The spiritual condition of Iraq:</strong> 
                              As Iraq&#8217;s government becomes more democratic, 
                              there is an increased likelihood that more Christians 
                              would be allowed to come in and worship and evangelize. 
                              It is also likely that the same Christians would 
                              be persecuted for their beliefs. Pray that God would 
                              raise leaders to minister to Iraq&#8217;s spiritual 
                              condition and that Iraq would be a fertile ground 
                              for the Gospel.</li>
