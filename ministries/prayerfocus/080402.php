                          the end of each summer, the servant team of our church 
                          gathers together for prayer and planning as we prepare 
                          for the fall. This year, the retreat will be August 
                          22nd through 24th. Please keep our church leaders in 
                          prayer as they spend time together at this important 
                          event.<br>

                              There is a lot of work to be done as our church 
                              undergoes various changes and transitions. Pray 
                              that the leaders of our church would be given a 
                              refreshed sense of calling to the task that God 
                              has given them. Pray that they can serve with joy 
                              and devotion, with a full view of God's will and 
                              intention for our church. Also pray that they will 
                              be given a God given compassion for the people that 
                              God has called them to minister to.<br>
                              <br>

                            <li> <b>Heart 
                              of Love and Humility:</b> Pray that each servant 
                              would have a greater understanding of God's love 
                              for His people. Pray for humility, as every servant 
                              needs to grow more and more in the grace and knowledge 
                              of our LORD, and also pray that each servant would 
                              have an unquenchable desire to see the Kingdom of 
                              God built in our generation.<br>

                            <li> <b>Worship:</b> 
                              Dr. Steve Lee from Faith Alliance Bible Church in 
                              Chicago, IL will be giving the main addresses. Pray 
                              that he will come with anointing and spiritual power 
                              as he delivers the Word of God. Also pray that the 
                              church leaders would enjoy powerful times of prayer, 
                              where they connect and commune with God, experienceing 
                              His touch and knowing His love. May the minister 
                              as they have been ministered to.<b><br>

                            <li> <b>Spiritual 
                              Direction:</b> &quot;In his heart a man plans his 
                              course but the Lord determines his steps.&quot; 
                              (Proverbs 16:9). Much of the planning for the fall 
                              has already been done, with adjustments to be made 
                              at this retreat and as the fall approaches. But, 
                              ultimately, we know that the LORD's Will will be 
                              done. Pray that our church leaders will share one 
                              heart and one spirit as we seek to build God's Kingdom, 
                              and pray our leaders would be led by our one true 
                              Leader.</li>
