<p>
An area long wrought with crises, the turmoil in the Middle East grows
increasingly deadly each day. Hezbollah has killed several Israeli soldiers
and is now holding two captive. In retaliation, Israel is now waging war with Lebanon, which the Israeli government holds responsible for these acts. At the time of this writing, 300 Lebanese are dead and 500,000 displaced.
<p>
Hezbollah is a militant political organization in Lebanon, which occupies Southern Lebanon on the Israeli border. It was formed in the 1980's by Shia Muslim clerics and receives support for its military force from the Syrian and Iranian governments.
<p>
<b>Prayer requests:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Diplomatic process:</b> Pray that God would bless the diplomatic process as the international community meets to resolve the issue.</li>
<li><b>Hezbollah:</b> Recognized by most nations as a terrorist organization, Hezbollah has been using violence since its inception to assert its political views.</li>
<li><b>Arabs and Jews:</b> Tension in this area between Muslims and Jews is unlike any ethnic/racial conflict in human history. Pray that God would reveal himself to both people groups.</li>
<li><b>Christians in the Middle East:</b> Pray for safety and comfort and that God would use these people for His glory in this time of need.</li>
