<p>
For the past two years, Dr. Steve Lee and his family have been serving the Lord in Kenya through medical missions.  Dr. Steve has been working with the hospital in Kapsowar, Kenya, and is currently visiting the U.S.
<p>
GCC has partnered with the Lee family in their faithful service in Kenya.  Let us continually remember them in prayer.
<p>
<b>Please pray for:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>God’s blessing on their work in Kenya.</b>  Pray for the community in Kapsowar, as Dr. Steve has worked with various levels in government, including former and present Presidents, to support for the hospital’s work.  Pray that at all levels, God would have his favor and blessing upon the work being done there.</li>
<li><b>The Lee family and all of its members.</b>  Shortly after their arrival in Kenya, Judah Lee was born, the fifth of the Lee children.  Please remember Dr. Steve, his wife Betty, and their children Joy, Noelle, Luke, Bethany and Judah during their time in Kenya.  Pray for their safety, health, and continued growth in God’s favor as the family commits to doing His kingdom work.</li>
<li><b>God’s ultimate glory manifested through their work in Kenya.</b></li>
</ul>
