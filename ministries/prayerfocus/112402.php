                          <p align="left">When 
                            India was formed in 1947, the British agreed to transfer 
                            power, giving way to a Muslim state of Pakistan (with 
                            two sections West and East) and a largely Hunda India. 
                            With over 967,000,000, Indaia is home to 15% of the 
                            world's population. Of that amount, 83% or 802.5 million 
                            are Hindu. Through intimidation and terror, Christians 
                            numbering about 23 million form a minority. The accounts 
                            of such persecution are steadily increasing, with 
                            more frequent threats of violence against Christians 
                            working in India.</p>
                          <p align="left">Recently, 
                            on September 22, 2002, members of the Bajrang Dal, 
                            a militant youth organization, attacked eight Korean 
                            missionaries in Bihar State during worship services. 
                            On August 2002, a group against the construction of 
                            a church building in Maharashtra state, burned church 
                            materials, including corrugated sheets of metal, during 
                            the middle of the night. </p>
                          <p align="left">And 
                            since July 23, 202, four page documents are being 
                            circulated among the extremist Hindus, calling for 
                            a &quot;terror campaign to be waged against Christians, 
                            Muslims, tribes, and backward castes.&quot;</p>
