                        <p align="left">After 
                          the Vietnam War, Cambodia fell under the rule of the 
                          Khmer Rouge (1975-1978) under which almost all former 
                          military personnel, civil servants, and educated or 
                          wealthy people were killed. The entire nation was then 
                          turned into a vast labor camp. When the Vietnamese Army 
                          ousted the Khmer Rouge in 1978, a civil war between 
                          4 parties raged until 1991. </p>
                        <p align="left">Finally, 
                          with international help, a democracy was set up with 
                          the first elections happening in 1998. However the efforts 
                          to rebuild have not been easy with a largely illiterate 
                          population, poverty-ridden countryside and a lack of 
                          even basic infrastructure. </p>
                        <p align="left">Formerly 
                          known as Siam, Thailand is the only Southeast Asian 
                          country never controlled by a European power. Because 
                          of this, the name Thailand was adopted, which means 
                          &#8220;Land of the Free&#8221;. Thailand currently struggles 
                          with rampant corruption in almost every level of government 
                          which has contributed to the large sex trade, drug network, 
                          crime syndicates, and ecological degradation. Though 
                          missionaries have worked in Thailand for nearly 400 
                          years, growth has been very slow.</p>

                              on a mission to Asia. Pray for the details and preparations

                              Pray for unity in spirit and a vision for the lost 
                              in Asia. <br>
