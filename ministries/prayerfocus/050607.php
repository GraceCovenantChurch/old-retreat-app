<p>
Nearly three weeks ago, on April 16, 23 year-old Seung-Hui Cho killed 32 people and wounded many more on the campus of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in Blacksburg, Virginia. Cho then proceeded to shoot himself.  It has been called the deadliest shooting in the modern history of the United States.
Please continue to keep this event in prayer even as time passes.
<p>
<b>Prayer Requests:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Continued Support and Comfort:</b> Pray that God would continue to provide support and comfort to those who seek it.</li>
<li><b>Campus Leadership:</b> Pray that God would use the organizations and fellowships on the Virginia Tech campus to lead the students through this difficult time.  Also pray for the school’s faculty, which has the difficult task of trying return to business and restore a sense of normalcy.</li>
<li><b>Faith:</b> Pray that God would grant greater faith to everyone, whether they were directly or indirectly involved.  Pray that people would be able to place their trust in Him and recognize His</li>
