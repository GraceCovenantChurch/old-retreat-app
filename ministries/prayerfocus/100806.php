<p>
The Passion Revival Conference will run from 10/12 to 10/14 this year, and is a weekend during which we devote each evening to worship, prayer, and listening to the Word as it is preached.  This year, we are privileged to have Dr. Charles Zimmerman of Biblical Seminary as our guest speaker.  The theme will be “His Faithfulness.”
Also coming up this weekend is the GCC Alumni Picnic, which will bring together brothers and sisters who may not have seen one another for several years.  Pray for both events.
<p><b>Prayer Requests:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b style="font-weight: bold;">Dr.</b><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Charles Zimmerman:</span> Pray for the physical and spiritual health of the main speaker, and that his sermons may be Word-centered.</li>
<li><b>Open eyes, ears, and hearts:</b> Several of the members of our church were saved through this conference.  Pray that God continues to use it to work in people’s lives, and that the congregation may come ready to be moved.</li>
<li><b>Alumni:</b> Pray that GCC alumni continue to be a community even after leaving the church, and that this weekend may renew friendships and strengthen bonds.</li>
<li><b>Logistics:</b> Both the conference and the alumni weekend require plenty of logistics.  Pray that travel, weather, and audio/visual technicalities go smoothly.</li></ul>
