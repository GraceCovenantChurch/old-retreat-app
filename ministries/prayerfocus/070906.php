<p>
Although it is still months away, Urbana 2006 has already created a buzz nationwide.  This missions conference, sponsored by InterVarsity, is one of the largest Christian conferences in the nation.  Tens of thousands of attendees, mostly students, have gathered since 1946 to meet with God and catch a glimpse of His vision for the world.  This year, more than 25,000 will gather in St. Louis to see how God might use the skills and resources each of us have for His kingdom work.
<p>
While it remains several months away, prayerfully remember Urbana and consider committing to attend.  For more information and registration, visit <a href="http://www.urbana.org" target="_blank">http://www.urbana.org</a>.
<p>
<b>Please pray for:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>God’s blessing on the conference.</b>  Pray that God would be present and that the Spirit would be moving hearts to reveal His glory to everyone who attends.</li>
<li><b>The calling of many to serve in the Kingdom.</b>  Pray that hearts would be open to tracks, seminars, and exhibits as Urbana broadens the minds of many young people in terms of what "missions" can mean for our lives.</li>
<li><b>The fruit of Urbana 2006 all over the world.</b>  Pray that churches, missionaries, people groups, and nations would feel the impact of a time when God’s people gather to pray and commit to being a Christian by accepting His commission, in whatever form that may be.</li>
