                          Afghanistan:</strong></p>
                        <p>Following 
                          the overthrow of the Taleban regime in 2001, the United 
                          Nations and Western governments supported an interim 
                          government in Afghanistan led by Hamid Karzai. The new 
                          government brings hope for democracy after years of 
                          a Communist regime, civil war, and in-fighting. Currently, 
                          NATO (North leads international peacekeeping force in 
                          Kabul. Many parts of country are controlled by regional 
                          warlords and their private militias and there are still 
                          attacks by Taleban remnants and militant groups. </p>
                        <p>Presidential 
                          elections planned for October 9, 2004. There are 18 
                          presidential candidates this year. Parliamentary elections 
                          will be held next year. About 10.5 million Afghans have 
                          registered to vote and almost half of them are women. 
                          They will be voting from all corners of the nation and 
                          as refugees in other countries. <br>

                            Afghanistan has been experiencing some growing pains 
                            ever since the fall of the Taleban. Pray that God 
                            would send workers there to spread the Gospel and 
                            help the nation&#8217;s citizens.<br>
