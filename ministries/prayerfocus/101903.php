                            God of Israel and that I am Your servant and have 
                            done all these things at Your command. Answer me, 
                            O Lord, answer me, so these people will know that 
                            You, O Lord are God, and that You are turning their 
                            hearts back again.&#8221; Then the fire of the Lord 
                            fell and burned up the sacrifice. <br>
