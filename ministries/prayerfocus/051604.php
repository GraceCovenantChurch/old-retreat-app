                          summer is always a fun time at our church, full of times 
                          of fellowship and spiritual awakening. While many students 
                          go home or to internships,there are many who stay and 
                          participate in family groups. </p>

                          are a few prayer requests for our church in the summer:</strong></p>

                              from Philadelphia. Please pray that our students 
                              would love God through the Word and through prayer 
                              even while they are working or staying at home. 
                              Summer can be a very important time for growth and

                              attending GCC, please pray that through family groups 
                              and the many fellowship activities (like the basketball 
                              and bowling tournaments), they could meet with God 
                              and truly develop a closer relationship with Him 
                              and a humble heart for others.<br>

                              brings an incredible opportunity for missions, as 
                              all four teams plan to share the Gospel throughout 
                              the world and here in Philadelphia. As they seek 
                              to worship God through their lives, let&#8217;s 
                              pray that the Atlanta, Cambodia, Peru, and Inner 
                              City Teams will impact the world for Jesus.<br>

                              pastors as each of them are undertaking many ministry 
                              opportunities. This summer, Pastor Young will be 
                              at various speaking engagements which are listed 
                              on the announcements. Pastor Matt is preparing to 
                              go to Atlanta and Pastor Paul is preparing to go 
                              out on the mission field. Please pray for effective 
                              God-breathed ministries and strength to pursue God&#8217;s
