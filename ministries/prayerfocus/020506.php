<p>
The island nation of Sri Lanka, off the coast of India, has been engaged in civil war for more than 20 years.  The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam is a terrorist insurgent group that has sought to uproot and overthrow the Sri Lankan government.  In addition to these longstanding problems, Sri Lanka continues to recover from the tsunami in 2004.
<p>
The nation is 6.2% Christian and the persecution is extremely high.  Recently, a prominent Tamil politician was shot attending a late night Christmas service at a church.  Attacks on churches in Sri Lanka.
<p>
<b>Please pray for:</b>
<ul>
 <li><b>Permanent peace for the civil unrest.</b>  While a ceasefire has been in place for several years, the LTTE and the government in power have exchanged eye-for-an-eye attacks and the possibility of violence remains high.  Please pray that God would give peace to the fighting people groups so that they might find Christ as one nation.</li>
 <li><b>Continued tsunami relief and reconstruction efforts.</b>  Although the efforts have been successful, the nation continues to rebuild its infrastructure and many smaller towns are still in the midst of restarting their entire lives.  Pray that Christians on the ground would illustrate Christ the great Provider as they help in whatever ways possible.</li>
 <li><b>God’s glory in the work of the local Sri Lankan church</b> through outreach and expanded evangelism efforts in that region.</li>
