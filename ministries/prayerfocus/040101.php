                          Pastors - April 01, 2001</strong></P>
                        <p align="left">This 
                          week we would like to devote our prayers to our pastoral 
                          staff: Reverend Young Kim, Pastor David Alas, Pastor 
                          Paul Chi, and Pastor Paul Liu. The Hebrews writer tells 
                          us that the work of the leader is to watch over our 
                          sould and that they are accountable to God. Pastoring 
                          a church is not an easy task. In addition to the roles 
                          and responsibilities they have in this body, our pastors 
                          have personal obligations as well. As they shepherd 
                          and lead this church, and as they live their daily lives, 
                          let us pray that God would use them powerfully to help 
                          raise kingdom workers in our generation to the glory 
                          of God!</p>
                        <p align="left"><b>Prayer 
                          Requests - </b>Let use keep our pastors in prayer as 
                          they continue to serve the LORD through this church.</p>
