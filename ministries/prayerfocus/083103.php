                        <p align="left">On 
                          Friday, August 30th, a car bomb tore through Iraq&#8217;s 
                          holiest Shiite Muslim shrine, leaving 107 victims in 
                          its wake. Among the victims was Ayatollah Mohammed Baqir 
                          al-Hakim, one of the most important Shiite clerics in 
                          Iraq who had also been cooperating with the American 
                          peace-keeping efforts. The materials of the bombing 
                          are said to be same as those used in the August 19th 
                          UN bombing. </p>
                        <p align="left">Iraqi 
                          police arrested 4 al-Qaida linked suspects for the bombing 
                          on Saturday, two of whom are suspected to be supporters 
                          of the old Saddam Hussein regime. The four confessed 
                          that they planned this attack and several others in 
                          an attempt to destabilize the country. So far the attack 
                          has succeeded in directing Iraqi anger towards the US 
                          coalition who is considered ultimately responsible for 
                          the attack by not providing adequate protection against 
                          such threats. 3000 Shiites marched in Baghdad at the 
                          gates of US coalition headquarters protesting the lack 
                          of security while tens of thousands of angry mourners 
                          filled the shrine and the streets of Najaf for funeral 
                          services for the bombing victims.</p>

                              that over 1500 pounds of explosives were packed 
                              into the two cars used at the bombing. The death 
                              toll continues to rise as workers search through 
                              the rubble and hundreds more have been injured. 
                              Please pray for the families of those who have lost

                              Restoration of Peace: </strong>US troops first arrived 
                              in Iraq in April of 2003 and toppled Saddam&#8217;s 
                              regime in 3 weeks. However, it has been months since 
                              then and there is still much to be done in restoring 
                              peace. Any infrastructure has been destroyed by 
                              the war and looting and in over half the cities, 
                              quality of life is worse than before the war started. 
                              There is rampant unemployment and several groups 
                              such as the one above try everything to distract 
                              the peacekeepers and promote unrest among the people.

                              The Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution, of which 
                              al-Hakim was the spiritual leader, has promised 
                              continued cooperation with America, however even 
                              among the various Shiite groups there has been fighting. 
                              Please pray for stability to come to an area that 
                              has suffered for decades and especially for the 
                              leaders of all sides as they fight to rebuild Iraq. 
                              Please pray also that God would use even these circumstances 
                              to advance the work of His kingdom and that somehow 
                              His word would shine forth in an almost entirely
