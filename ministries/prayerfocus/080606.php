<p>
Israel's campaign against Lebanon has heightened within this past week.  It began three weeks ago after Hezbollah militants crossed into northern Israel, kidnapped two soldiers and killed three others.  Hezbollah is a militant political organization which has oppressed Lebanon for years.  This past week, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. vowed to strike Tel Aviv (Israel’s capital) in retaliation for Israel's bombardment of the Lebanese capital.  These statements have led to ongoing strikes and campaigns.
<p>
Lebanon says more than 900 people have died since then, most of them civilians. Israel has lost 27 civilians and 40 soldiers.  Increased violence has resulted from tensions between both sides.
<p>
