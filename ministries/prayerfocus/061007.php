<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">
Chester, Pennsylvania</span>, a city of 36,000 directly south of Philadelphia, is easily accessible from the major interstate running through it. Historically, Chester was a thriving, prosperous city.  After the recessions of 1975 and 1982, Chester's economic base suffered great losses as businesses moved out of the city. Compounded by a long history of government corruption, the city is now faced with overwhelming problems.  World Impact missionaries live across the street from two federal housing projects inChester.
