<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />Spring Break</span><br /><br />College students look forward to spring break every year as a chance to temporarily get away from the rigors of academics, have fun with friends, and travel to new places.  It can be a time of refreshment and an opportunity to fortify relationships.  Even for those who are not going anywhere, the break is a welcome time of rest.
<p>
As the different campuses get ready to take their respective breaks, please keep them in prayer.
</p>
<p><b>Prayer Requests:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Safety: </span>Pray for the safety of those who are traveling, especially those who are spending long hours on the road or taking flights.</li>
<li><b>Productivity: </b>Pray that the break is productive.  Whether people are staying on campus, going home, or traveling with friends, pray that they do not fall into the trap of idleness, and that even times of rest can be fruitful.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fellowship: </span>Pray that the time spent over spring break is pleasing and glorifying to God.  Pray that relationships are strengthened and that people can come back from their breaks with a better understanding of what a Godly friendship is.</li></ul>
