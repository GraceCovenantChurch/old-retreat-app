<p>
<p>
This past week, the United Nations released a report describing the oppression imposed by the North Korean government.  The report details some of the terrible incidents of religious and moral human rights violations, including the brutal state-initiated murders of many Christians.
<p>
North Korea operates under a completely totalitarian regime, led by President Kim Jong-Il, the son of Kim Il-Sung, often referred to as the Great Leader.  The nation runs under tight dictatorial rule; nationalistic brainwashing dominates all aspects of the culture, forcing the citizenry to live in constant fear.  It is a closed country, where virtually no one is allowed in or out, with the exception of a limited number of merchants from China.  On the international front, North Korea has been hostile, creating high tension with threats of developing nuclear weaponry.
<p>
<b>Please pray for:</b>
<p>
<ul>
 <li><b>Immediate relief for the oppressed.</b>  Reports of horrible prison camps and mass starvation heavily weigh on the NK population.  Pray that somehow, through international relief efforts or relenting within the government, the people there would receive the desperate help they need.</li>
 <li><b>Strength in the underground body of Christ.</b>  Christians are persecuted more than others; the government once declared God to be the number one enemy of the country.  Please pray that pure and refined faith would emerge from the hardships brought, preparing the way for a Holy Spirit breakthrough among those people.</li>
