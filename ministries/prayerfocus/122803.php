                            the birth of the our Lord Jesus, the Prince of Peace, 
                            was surrounded in violence following a decree from 
                            Herod that every male child 2 years old and under 
                            be killed to ensure that no rival could rise up and 
                            challenge Herod&#8217;s rule as King of the Jews. 
                            Even Jesus&#8217; death was a gruesome execution on 
                            the cross and yet through both, Jesus fulfilled his 
                            calling as the Prince of Peace who miraculously reconciled 
                            a sinful people to a Holy Father. </p>

                            Christmas Day we celebrate the birth of one who brought 
                            the gift of perfect salvation to an imperfect world. 
                            However, more than 2000 years after Jesus&#8217; birth, 
                            the world still awaits full perfection in the final 
                            return of its king and this year&#8217;s holiday season 
                            is no less violent than the first. Please pray, especially 
                            in this holiday season, for those that suffer while 
                            the world celebrates.</p>

                                in months for Israel. Five Israelis died in a

                                were killed in a completely separate attack by

                                Jihad. The two countries have been trying for 
                                weeks to rebuild the shattered &#8220;Roadmap&#8221;

                                30 meters tall. Although only a few people died 
                                in the initial blast, many more have died in the 
                                aftermath from poisoning and chemical burns. The

                                attempt on his life in 11 days when two suicide

                                passed by, killing at least 14 bystanders. Musharraf 
                                told state television that Muslim militants were 
                                most likely responsible, having been angered by 
                                Musharraf&#8217;s decision from 2 years ago to 
                                turn against the Taleban and help the US in their

                                &#8211; For many Christians around the world, 
                                celebrating Christmas Day could cost them their 
                                well-being, or even their very lives. Christian 
                                Freedom International, an organization that serves 
                                the persecuted church, has highlighted India, 
                                Burma, Sudan, and Turkey as some of the countries 
                                in which the church suffers the harshest persecution. 
                                Please pray that the church in these areas will 
                                cling to the hope that this day represents. For
