                          The 
                          manufacturing city of Ryongchon, North Korea suffered 
                          a train bombing this past Thursday. It is reported that 
                          two wagons carrying dynamite hit a live wire and caused 
                          the explosion, killing 54 people and injuring 1,200. 
                          The accident also flattened 1,850 homes and damaged 
                          another 6,500. These numbers are probably still lower 
                          than the actual statistics, as search agents continue 
                          to find many more casualties. The accident ranks among 
                          the world&#8217;s worst train disasters to date.</p>
                        <p align="left">Although 
                          the North Korean government has not reported the incident 
                          on its state media, it has invited the United Nations 
                          and other organizations such as the Red Cross to aid 
                          victims and families. Nations such as South Korea, Russia, 
                          and Australia and the UK have offered help. Some individual 
                          citizens from across the NK-Chinese border (20 miles 
                          from the city) have also been giving assistance.</p>

                              subsistence. Please pray that God would provide 
                              enough aid through the UN and various support groups.<br>

                              This accident could be another source of diplomatic 
                              tension or the beginning of diplomatic breakthroughs 
                              with North Korea, which has been considered a rogue 
                              state. Pray that the leaders of the world (especially 
                              of the UN, US, South Korea, China, Russia and Japan) 
                              would have wisdom in handling the situation. <br>

                              There is now a significant number of Christian missionaries, 
                              most of whom are Chinese and South Korean, living 
                              on the Chinese side of the border. There are an 
                              estimated 300 small churches here and they have 
                              been helping North Korean defectors cross into China 
                              and then to South Korea. Pray that they would receive 
                              more opportunities to fearlessly aid victims and 
                              defectors and teach them the Gospel.</li>
