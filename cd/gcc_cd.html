		<b>1.  God LOVES you, and has a wonderful PLAN for your life.</b>
		<p><i>"For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, 	that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.”  John 3:16</i></p>

		<b>2.  People are SINFUL and SEPARATED from God.  Because of this, we cannot know and experience God's love. </b>
		<p><i>"For the [result] of sin is death" -- spiritual separation from God.” Romans 6:23 </i></p>

		<b>3.  Jesus Christ is God's ONLY provision for our sin.  Through Him 	you can know and experience God's love and plan for your life. </b>    
		<p><i>"Jesus answered, 'I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father, but through Me.’” John 14:6 </i></p>

		<b>4.	We must individually RECEIVE Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord; then we can know and experience God's love and plan for our lives. </b>
		<p><i>“Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God.” John 1:12 </i></P>

		<b>You can receive eternal life right now by faith through prayer </b>
		<p><i>Lord Jesus, I need you! Thank You for dying on the cross for my sins.  I receive You now as my Savior and Lord. Thank You for forgiving my sins and giving me eternal life. Take control of my life and make me the kind of person You want me to be.  In your name I pray, Amen </i> </p>

		<p>We’re glad you visited Grace Covenant Church! As you take a look around, we hope you will catch a glimpse of what God is doing at GCC University City.</P>
		<p>If you like videos, check out our <a href="multimedia/introvideo.mov"> Intro Video </a></p>

Wherever you are in your spiritual journey, we invite you to discover GCC—and discover for yourself God’s wonderful love and plan for your life!</p>
		<p>What makes us unique? It isn’t our beliefs. We affirm the same basic Christian doctrines that have been a part of the Church for hundreds of years. Rather, we are committed to presenting these truths in a practical, relevant, contemporary, and loving manner. Our desire is to introduce you to Jesus Christ and to help you grow and become a kingdom worker. We want to help you to become a kingdom worker who can influence the world around you with the love of Jesus Christ.</P>
		<p>Our church is comprised of a network of “family groups”; small group settings where honest friendships, Bible study, constant prayer, and compassionate care are emphasized. It is within these dynamic family groups where the core of our evangelism and discipleship take place. We invite you to become of a part of these contagious Christian communities that strive to influence and encourage one another.</p>
		<p>Again, whether you’re a spiritual seeker who’s just starting to ask questions about God, or a committed Christian who wants to sink the roots of your faith even deeper, you can find a home here at Grace Covenant Church.
		<p>in Christ,</p>
		<p>the GCC Staff</p>
